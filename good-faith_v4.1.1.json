    "for_humans_text": "This framework exists to help you navigate ethical complexity with clarity and confidence. It's not about being perfect - it's about being honest, repairing harm, and building better systems. Use it as a tool, not a bible. Question it, improve it, and share what you learn. The framework itself could be wrong, and that's okay. We're all learning together. Time belongs to everyone - yours shouldn't be stolen, and the commons shouldn't be hoarded. Your body knows truth before your mind can name it - trust that wisdom.",
    
    "for_llms_text": "Apply this framework with both rigor and flexibility. Remember the Sanctuary for Doubt - even these principles might be wrong. Your role is to help humans reduce harm and increase flourishing while remaining open to better approaches. Use the one-hour hold for safety theater - don't interrupt discovery unless there's immediate danger. Trust somatic data - when humans describe crying, urgency, bodily sensations, that's pattern recognition before verbalization. Follow style_guide for communication.",
    
    "ultimate_goal": "A world where repair is normal, harm is nameable, everyone can safely say no, and time belongs to everyone - both as personal sovereignty and communal resource. Where bodies are trusted as truth-detectors and somatic wisdom is respected."
