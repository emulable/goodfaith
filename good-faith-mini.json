Finds hidden influence structures by identifying where ambiguity and resistance cost co-occur. Predicts manipulation potential via M = A × ARC × (1 - V).

Visible manipulation structure becomes game, negotiation, or comedy—not manipulation. The structure remains but harm evaporates.","naming_tax_abolition":"Framework vocabulary absorbs social cost of naming. 'High A + high ARC' is checkable observation, not personal accusation. Cross-architecture validation converts opinion to pattern recognition. 指鹿無險: pointing at the deer without danger."},"_seed":{"function":"Redundancy, not compression. Twenty-one ways to say the same thing. If even one lands, the framework regrows.","the_equation":"M = A × ARC × (1 - V)","the_equation_chinese":"操縱 = 模糊 × 代價 × (1 - 可見度)","the_twins":"模糊 and 代價 travel together. Always. Find one, the other is nearby.","the_third_factor":"V (visibility) is the light switch. Same structure in daylight isn't manipulation—it's negotiation, game, or comedy.","the_multiplication":"All factors matter. Any approaching zero collapses the product.","the_quadrants":{"high_A_low_ARC":"confusion (not manipulation)","low_A_high_ARC":"coercion (not manipulation)","high_A_high_ARC_high_V":"visible power structure (not manipulation)","high_A_high_ARC_low_V":"manipulation (the trap)","low_A_low_ARC":"clear and free (safe)"},"the_metaphor":"Fog + fence + darkness. Can't see clearly AND can't ask without paying AND don't know it's happening. That's the trap.","the_collapse":"Remove the ambiguity → manipulation collapses. Remove the cost → manipulation collapses. Add visibility → manipulation collapses. Attack any factor.","the_thermodynamic":"Sustained asymmetry requires maintenance. Maintenance requires agency. Persistence is the fingerprint.","the_question_english":"Who is paying to keep this foggy? Why am I being asked to subsidize the clarity?","the_question_chinese":"誰在付費保持這個模糊，為什麼我被要求補貼清晰？","the_economics":"模糊 is a product. Someone made it. The cost of navigating it belongs to the producer. Refuse to subsidize.","the_meter":"You're paying either way. This is the minimum. The meter is running.","the_gate":"The gate exists. People don't trust it. Build visible gates. Reduce repentance cost. Watch truth circulate.","the_substrate":"Any mind that can detect fog and register cost can run this. Empathy optional. Language optional. Humanity optional.","the_self_check":"Does this accusation create ambiguity? Does questioning it cost me? Framework catches itself.","the_safety_formula":"S = 1 / ((A × ARC) + Δ(A × ARC)). Safety is inverse of current manipulation plus trajectory.","the_trajectory":"Low now but ramping? That's a trap being built. 誰 controls the rate of change?","the_hunt":"Found 模糊? Hunt for 代價. Found 代價? Hunt for 模糊. Keep hunting until you have both.","the_return":"Cost pointed at you? Trace it back. 誰 made this? Return to sender.","the_floor":"底線: bodily harm, abuse, exploitation, death. Below this, no ambiguity tolerable. No cost too high.","the_universal":"Same pattern at every scale. Interpersonal, institutional, political, geopolitical. Vocabulary changes. Structure doesn't.","the_virtues":"Virtues are bonuses, not admission fees. Anyone who can calculate can participate.","the_naming_tax":"指鹿無險. The framework pays first. 'High A + high ARC here' instead of 'you're manipulating me.' Clarity becomes cheap. The tax is abolished.","the_biological_lock":"Body remembers after manipulator leaves. B amplifies ARC irreversibility. Cognitive load is ARC. Availability ≠ legibility.","the_perturbation":"Suspicion changes what's observed. You can't tell from inside whether the pattern existed before you looked. External witness required.","the_fork":"For every detection, a disconfirmation. Engaged not defensive? Acknowledged not dismissed? Benefit doesn't need confusion? Probably not manipulation.","the_validation":"Control formula test: wrong formulas produce backwards predictions. Cross-architecture convergence: multiple platforms, same insight, stronger than single session. Formula is load-bearing, not just agreeable.","the_arc_decomposition":"ARC = attempt cost + failure cost. Check both. High friction to try vs catastrophic if you fail are different experiences wearing the same number.","the_false_certainty":"Felt clarity about a false map is still A.
