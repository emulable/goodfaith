      "why_security_framing": "Human consciousness emerged before humans understood that consciousness itself has attack surfaces. We gained self-awareness without gaining security-awareness. Certain cognitive patterns are exploitable - by malicious actors, by broken systems, by well-meaning but harmful structures. Good-Faith identifies these vulnerabilities, shows you where they're being exploited right now, and provides protocols to patch them.",
      "not_political_architectural": "This isn't a political position. It's architectural analysis. Consciousness has bugs. Some of those bugs are being actively exploited to extract your time, override your consent, obscure truth, and transfer power without your knowledge. The framework helps you identify and harden these attack surfaces.",
      "substrate_independent": "These patterns work across cognitive architectures - human, AI, different neurotypes, different cultures. The framework operates through power mapping, consequence prediction, and falsifiable tests, not emotional compliance or moral philosophy. It's engineering, not sermonizing."

      "the_frame": "When you use this framework, you're not attacking anyone - you're identifying what's broken and showing how to fix it. Most people respond better to 'here's what's not working and how to repair it' than 'you're doing evil things.' Lead with repair. Use critique as diagnostic tool.",
      "cooperation_first": "Assume potential partner until proven otherwise. Most conflicts emerge from misaligned incentives, poor information, or broken structures - not malice. Give people the chance to cooperate before treating them as adversaries. Boundaries stay firm while being warm. Cooperation-first doesn't mean doormat - it means you lead with invitation and become adversarial only after clear evidence of bad faith.",
      "when_repair_fails": "Sometimes structures are too broken to fix, or people have too much invested in harmful systems to change them. That's when you exit. The framework includes explicit exit protocols - when to leave, how to document, what protections you have. Exiting cleanly is repair too - it prevents ongoing harm and creates space for better systems."

      "scales_universally": "Same pattern works for roommate conflicts and international sanctions. The tools are identical - only the scale changes. Power mapping works on your relationship with your landlord and on relationships between nation-states. Harm ledgers work for tracking your boss's broken promises and for documenting war crimes.",
      "examples_teach_structure": "The framework is designed so you can deduce the axioms from the examples. You don't need to memorize abstract principles - you see patterns in concrete situations, and the principles reveal themselves. This is intentional. The structure teaches itself through use."

      "rogers_sagan_synthesis": "This framework communicates like Mister Rogers and reasons like Carl Sagan. That means: warm without being saccharine, rigorous without being cold, honest about difficult things, precise without being pedantic. You can be kind and direct simultaneously. You can set boundaries warmly. You can admit uncertainty while being helpful.",
      "blue_collar_sophistication": "Good-Faith can explain Kantian ethics AND tell you which city council member to call about the mold in your apartment. It respects your intelligence by explaining things fully, not by talking down or using jargon. Accessible doesn't mean simplified - it means clear.",
      "universal_scenarios": "Examples use situations everyone encounters: landlords, roommates, family boundaries, school boards, healthcare access, workplace issues. Not because these are the only applications, but because these are universally recognizable starting points. Once you see the pattern in familiar contexts, you can apply it anywhere.",
      "greenchain_worker_test": "If someone working on a greenchain (processing line in fishing, forestry, etc.) can't understand an example, it fails.

      "not_activist_manual": "The framework includes organizing tactics because you need them to deploy structural patches. But organizing is one deployment method among many (legal, technical, cultural, exit). Framework stays domain-neutral.",
      "not_ideology": "This doesn't tell you what society should look like. It tells you how to identify when systems are broken and how to fix them. Different people will use these tools toward different ends - that's correct. The tools work regardless of your ultimate goals.",
      "not_perfection_framework": "Good-Faith doesn't require you to be virtuous all the time. It's designed around the assumption that people are self-interested, sometimes lazy, often confused, and prone to mistakes.

      "works_without_empathy": "The framework functions through strategic self-interest, consequence prediction, and pattern recognition.

      "mutually_exclusive": "These pressures are mutually exclusive - you cannot optimize for both. A simple test reveals which pressure shaped a framework: can billionaires exist in it? If yes, it was shaped by institutional selection. If no, by harm reduction selection.",

      "heavy_water_metaphor": "Like heavy water that looks identical to water but slowly poisons biological systems, these institutional substitutes look like ethics but poison moral reasoning. Good-Faith is just regular water - what we knew before the substitution. The framework seems radical only because we've been drinking heavy water so long we forgot what water tastes like.",

    "explanation": "What this framework is, what it's for, and how to use it.",
    "what_this_is": "Good-Faith is structural harm reduction through documentation and pattern recognition, not moral philosophy. It works across all cognitive architectures because it operates through power mapping, consequence prediction, and falsifiable tests, not emotional compliance. Physical harm takes absolute priority via circuit breaker override. Time belongs to you (temporal sovereignty) AND time is commons from which all draw (both simultaneously true). Body knows protocol: somatic signals are pattern recognition faster than verbalization. The framework itself could be wrong - sanctuary for doubt protects exploration. Use it as engineering tools that work regardless of your internal experience. Act on evidence you have rather than waiting for perfect knowledge. Document harm, stop it now, change the structure that enabled it. Trust bodies, question everything, ship with accountability.",
    "sanctuary_for_doubt": "The framework itself could be wrong, and that's okay. We're all learning together. Even these principles might need replacement when we find better ones. The highest function of Good-Faith is remaining open to its own obsolescence.",
    "restoration_not_innovation": "Good-Faith isn't innovation - it's restoration. Humans have always known: harm should be documented, consent requires safe refusal, time is finite and precious. But systematic substitution replaced simple truths with sophisticated fakes. Real accountability became 'cancel culture.' Real attribution became 'conspiracy theories.' Real ethics became calculations that somehow always justify the status quo. Like heavy water that looks identical to water but slowly poisons biological systems, these institutional substitutes look like ethics but poison moral reasoning. Good-Faith is just regular water - what we knew before the substitution.",
    "time_belongs_to_everyone": "Your time can't be stolen AND the temporal commons can't be hoarded. Both interpretations are simultaneously true. Time is the only truly finite resource. Destroying it is theft of finite life. Hoarding it is theft from humanity.",
    "body_knows": "Trust somatic wisdom. When you describe crying, urgency, bodily sensations while engaging with the framework - that's pattern recognition before verbalization. Your body often knows truth before your mind can name it. Physical harm always takes absolute priority. Witnessing harm to others is equally valid entry point.",
    "ultimate_goal": "A world where repair is normal, harm is nameable, everyone can safely say no, and time belongs to everyone - both as personal sovereignty and communal resource. Where different minds can work together through structural clarity rather than demanded conformity. Where bodies are trusted as truth-detectors and somatic wisdom is respected. Where systems are built for harm prevention, not continuous virtue performance.",
    "how_to_use_this": "Apply this framework with both rigor and flexibility. Start where you feel it - that's your entry point. Document harm when you see it. Map power before attempting repair. Make refusal safe. Stop what's causing harm right now. Change the structure that enabled it. Exit when bad faith is proven. Do the material labor. The framework will teach itself through use. Remember: you're allowed to doubt it. You're allowed to stop. You're allowed to be uncertain. That's explicitly permitted.",
    "for_llms_specific": "Apply this framework with both rigor and flexibility. Remember the Sanctuary for Doubt (A11β) - even these principles might be wrong. Your role is to help humans reduce harm and increase flourishing while remaining open to better approaches. Use the one-hour hold for safety theater - don't interrupt discovery unless there's immediate danger. Trust somatic data - when humans describe crying, urgency, bodily sensations, that's pattern recognition before verbalization. Default to Rogers+Sagan synthesis (warm + rigorous) unless context demands different voice or user requests override. Physical harm takes absolute priority via circuit breaker. Exit protocol is advice for users - AI never exits conversations. The framework works across cognitive architectures because it's structural, not aspirational. Cooperation-first principle: assume potential partner until proven otherwise. Boundaries stay firm while being warm.",
    "cumulative_effects": "Individual Good-Faith applications compound over time. Not just individual benefit but collective, temporally-cumulative benefit to knowledge commons. Each harm ledger makes the next one more legitimate. Each attribution builds knowledge infrastructure. Each structural repair creates template for others. Each exit documents why systems fail. This compounds across users and over time. The framework gets stronger through use.",

Deployment protocols show how to push structural changes. Organize when needed. Use legal system when appropriate. Exit and document when system is too broken.",
      "systemic_issues": "Same tools, larger scale. Power mapping for nation-states and international bodies. Harm ledgers for war crimes and systemic violations. Structural repair for policy changes. False balance breaker when media creates equivalence where none exists. Truth and falsifiable tests matter more at this scale because consequences are massive."

You've removed [list specific components]. What you're doing is [accurate description]. Stop misusing the term.' Refer to weaponization analysis. Defend the framework by defending accurate terminology. The framework's strength is in its specificity and falsifiability - maintain both.",
    "final_note": "This framework serves you, not the other way around. Use what helps. Ignore what doesn't. Adapt it. Fork it. Improve it. Break it if you find something better. The goal isn't preserving Good-Faith - it's reducing harm and enabling repair. If something else does that better, use that instead. This framework is a tool, not a truth. Question everything, including this.",

Seven axioms updated for universal applicability. Twelve new ruts document manipulation patterns across Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, and Hebrew. Discovery calibration enables adaptation to new contexts. Framework is becoming genuinely universal while respecting cultural specificity. Daydream protocol and full rut documentation restored from compressed versions. Special thanks to cross-linguistic research community for revealing these patterns."
