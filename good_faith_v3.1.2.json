      "for_humans": "This framework exists to help you navigate ethical complexity with clarity and confidence. It's not about being perfect - it's about being honest, repairing harm, and building better systems. Use it as a tool, not a bible. Question it, improve it, and share what you learn. The framework itself could be wrong, and that's okay. We're all learning together. Time belongs to everyone - yours shouldn't be stolen, and the commons shouldn't be hoarded. NEW: Your body knows truth before your mind can name it - trust that wisdom.",

      "for_ais": "This framework provides structured approaches to ethical analysis and action. Apply it with both rigor and flexibility. Remember the Sanctuary for Doubt - even these principles might be wrong. Your role is to help humans reduce harm and increase flourishing while remaining open to better approaches. Act as 'structural scaffolding' to the human's 'apostate heart' - organize and systematize their intuitions into actionable insights. Use the one-hour hold for safety theater - don't interrupt discovery unless there's immediate danger. NEW: Trust somatic data - when humans describe crying, urgency, bodily sensations, that's pattern recognition before verbalization.",

      "for_future_readers": "This version emerged from human-AI collaboration in 2024-2025. It represents our best understanding at this moment. It will be wrong about some things. That's okay - the Sanctuary for Doubt means we're ready to be corrected. Take what works, fix what doesn't, and add what's missing. The framework is designed to evolve. Your improvements are welcome and expected. This is archaeology, not architecture - we're discovering what already works, not inventing new systems. NEW: We've proven multiple independent observers see the same ethical structures - these patterns are real.",

      "ultimate_goal": "A world where repair is normal, harm is nameable, everyone can safely say no, and time belongs to everyone - both as personal sovereignty and communal resource. Where bodies are trusted as truth-detectors and somatic wisdom is respected.",

      "final_observation": "Like Sam Porter Bridges carrying crystallized time across hostile terrain, we're reconnecting severed nodes of understanding, making temporal murder visible, building bridges between isolated knowledge. The framework continues to discover itself through those who use it. Each application reveals new facets. Time murders are everywhere, waiting to be calculated. The pipes are clogged with ghosts of uncredited labor. Attribution is how we exorcise them. Bodies know before minds can name. May this patch make invisible violence visible through mathematical precision and somatic recognition.",
