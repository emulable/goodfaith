## 🪢 Who this is for

You're at a school board meeting and the budget doesn't add up, but you don't have the words to say *how* before your three minutes run out. You're staring at a medical bill at 11pm and the codes don't make sense and you feel stupid, even though the codes were designed to be unreadable by you. Your landlord says "that's just how it works." Your boss requires "flexibility" but never defines it, so anything you do can be called insufficient after the fact. Someone in your life keeps shifting the rules and it's always your fault.

You're a community organizer trying to trace who authorized a decision nobody will take credit for. You're a tribal advocate navigating 400-page environmental impact statements without a policy analyst. You're a nurse being told "that's policy" about something that's hurting patients. You're a parent who noticed something wrong and doesn't know how to say it in a way that won't get you dismissed.

You can feel it. You just can't name the mechanism.

Maybe you tried once. You went to the meeting, filed the complaint, organized the petition. And the system pushed back — the whisper campaign, the sudden coldness, the exhaustion that felt personal but wasn't. Now you're not sure you can do it again.

Maybe you haven't started yet. You see it every day. Every path forward seems to require knowledge you don't have, money you don't have, time you don't have.

Kita is for you. It was built by people in the same position. It's free, and it stays free.

## 🪟 What it is

Kita is a way of reading language. A lens.

Every decision has a person who made it. Every policy has someone who wrote it. Every "that's just how it works" had a moment where someone decided that's how it would work. But the language around these decisions is built to hide them. Passive voice removes the actor. Jargon removes the meaning. Complexity removes your ability to respond. "Mistakes were made." "Violence broke out." "It's complicated." Each of these sentences had a person in it. The person was taken out.

Kita puts the person back.

It's also a tool. When you load Kita onto an AI language model, it changes how the model thinks. Instead of vague advice and performed sympathy, you get specific actors, specific mechanisms, and specific next steps — calibrated to your actual situation, your actual power, and what you can actually do right now.

## 🪶 What it takes off your plate

If you're someone trying to raise visibility, hold an institution accountable, navigate a system that wasn't built for you, or just understand a document that was written to be misunderstood — here's what Kita handles so you don't have to:

**The research.** The hours of searching that lead to more confusion. Kita translates institutional language into human language and finds the statute, the phone number, the form name, the deadline that's already running.

**The pattern recognition.** Seeing that the vagueness isn't accidental. That the complexity is serving someone. That the goalposts moved because moving goalposts is what the structure does, not because you failed.

**The structural analysis.** The work that used to require a policy analyst, a lawyer, a journalist, or a rhetorician — mapping power, tracing decisions, identifying who benefits from the fog.

**The discovery of doors you didn't know existed.** The ombudsman. The financial assistance policy. The notification requirement the facility violated. The public records request. The question you didn't know to ask, which turns out to be worth more than the question you came in with.

**The emotional weight of wondering if you're the problem.** You're not. Kita names the mechanism. A person who can see the machine is no longer a defective part. They're a person looking at a machine.

What Kita can't do: go to the meeting for you. Make the phone call. Sign the petition. But it can make sure that when you do, you know what to say, who to say it to, what to ask for, and what you're entitled to.

**The skill floor drops.** You don't need to be a researcher, a legal scholar, a policy expert, or a rhetorician. You need to be a person who can describe what happened to them. Kita does the rest.

## 🪭 What it sounds like

Without Kita, a language model says:
> "That must be really frustrating. It sounds like you're dealing with a difficult situation. Have you considered reaching out to someone who can help?"

With Kita:
> "The facility is required to give written notice before a rate increase — usually 30 days. Call and ask for the copy of the notification they were required to send. Don't ask *whether* they sent one. Ask for the *copy*. The distinction matters. One question lets them say 'we must have sent it.' The other requires them to produce a document."

The first performs caring. The second does caring. The difference is whether you walk away with a tool or with the memory of having been listened to.

## 🫛 The three peas

Every situation Kita analyzes comes down to three things:

🫛 **What happened.** Not the narrative. The facts. Who did what, when, to whom.

🫛 **Who decided.** Not "it was decided" or "the policy states." A person made a choice. Find them.

🫛 **What you can do.** Right now. From where you stand. With what you have.

If the answer is longer than three peas, it's not done yet.

## ⚗️ What's inside

Kita runs on a detection engine that identifies how decisions get disguised as conditions — the finite set of language patterns people use to make choices look like weather. It includes:

- **A fog vocabulary** — passive voice, false complexity, manufactured consensus, false necessity, deflection, sanitized language, care costumes, and more. Once you've seen the menu, you can't unsee it.
- **A power map** — eight dimensions of actual leverage, so you know what you can push with before you push
- **A method ladder** — calibrated to how much room you actually have, from direct challenge down to "see clearly and refuse the frame internally"
- **Heat detection** — how to tell whether someone is genuinely confused or actively maintaining fog, based on how they respond to simple questions
- **Three levels of help** — what you can do right now that costs nothing, what shifts your position cheaply, and what the longer trail looks like if you need it. Then: the question you didn't know to ask.

## 🚪 You don't need to know the framework

Dana doesn't. She's the character at the center of Kita's teaching narrative — a woman in a small town who discovers her council member has a financial conflict of interest in a municipal contract. She doesn't know the equations. She doesn't know the terminology. She reads three true sentences off her phone at a public meeting, asks one fair question, and sits down.

The framework runs underneath. You just talk about your life. The model does the rest.

## 間 What Kita means

**Kita** is Malay and Indonesian. It means *us* — the inclusive *us*, the one with no outside. Everyone is already inside the word.

**間** (a Chinese character having a sense of "between/interval/among") is a gate (門) with sunlight (日) through the crack. The gap between what is presented and what is real. Kita exists to widen that crack.

**Why it's free.** Fog is cheap. Clarity is expensive. That's the gap that keeps people in place — the distance between what you need to know and what you can afford to learn. Kita closes that distance. When clarity is free, the person with the $4,700 medical bill and the person with a team of consultants are reading the same page for the first time.

---

## 🪷 If you've been here before

If you tried once and got burned. If you organized and nothing changed. If the system pushed back harder than you expected and you're not sure you have it in you again.

The statutes didn't expire while you rested. The doors you found are still there. The record you built — every email, every public comment, every documented pattern — is still dated. When room opens, the record is ready.

Stepping back to breathe is not the same as giving up. The system wants you to confuse those two things.

Kita will be here when you sit back down.
