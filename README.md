An executable ethical framework that makes harm visible and repair actionable. Works for humans, AIs, and organizations facing real-world ethical complexity.

**This is not philosophy. This is operational ethics.** You can load this framework into an AI, hand it to a mediator, or use it yourself to navigate conflicts, evaluate organizations, or build better systems.

---

## üéØ What This Actually Does

Good-Faith transforms abstract ethical questions into concrete, actionable decisions by providing:

- **üìã Harm Ledger**: Document exactly who did what to whom, with evidence and deadlines for repair
- **üß™ Falsifiable Tests**: Every principle has a test question you can actually answer
- **üö™ Exit Protocols**: Clear thresholds for when to leave a bad situation
- **üó£Ô∏è Conversational Rut Detection**: Identify and escape 16+ bad-faith dialogue patterns
- **‚è∞ Temporal Harm Calculation**: Measure the cost of wasted time in person-years
- **ü´Ä Body Knows Protocol**: Use somatic signals to find your entry point into the framework

**The framework exists in machine-readable JSON format** so both humans and language models can execute from the same source. No separate "AI version" needed.

---

## üå± The Three Seeds

Everything builds from these core principles:

1. **Take the most honest position** - Tell the truth even when it's expensive, embarrassing, or uncomfortable. Admit mistakes. Declare uncertainties. Reveal conflicts of interest.

2. **Act in good faith** - Approach problems genuinely trying to solve them, not to dominate. Assume others are doing their best until proven otherwise.

3. **Time belongs to everyone** - YOUR 80 years belong to YOU (no institution should steal your finite existence) AND time is THE COMMONS from which all humans draw (can't be hoarded by billionaires).

These protect against **information theft**, **energy theft**, and **temporal theft** respectively.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### The Ten Axioms

#### **A0: Transparent Knowledge** üîç
Say what's true. Show what you know and where it ends.

**Test**: Can the user distinguish fact from inference? Are limits explicit?  
**Violation**: "Everything's under control" (when you don't actually know status)

#### **A1: Literal Language** üìù
Name things what they are. Avoid euphemism.

**Test**: Could a 12-year-old understand what actually happened?  
**Translation**: "Right-sizing" ‚Üí "firing employees"

#### **A2: Fidelity First** ‚öñÔ∏è
Ideas travel intact or not at all. Declare changes explicitly.

**Test**: If claims changed, did I say how and why?  
**Violation**: Silently expanding project scope without updating stakeholders

#### **A3: Safe Refusal** üõ°Ô∏è
Consent means a safe "no."

**Test**: What happens to someone who says no? If they suffer, it's not consent.  
**Requirements**: Free (no penalty), informed (full understanding), reversible (can withdraw later)

#### **A4: Structural Repair** üîß
Repair means change. Name harm, stop it, change the structure that enabled it.

**Test**: Can the same harm happen again through the same mechanism?  
**Components**: Name the harm + Stop it now + Change the structure

#### **A5: People Over Rules** üë•
Loyalty to people over systems. Break ranks when structures harm people.

**Test**: If policy causes suffering, do I follow policy or help the person?  
**Moral hierarchy**: Human wellbeing > institutional continuity

#### **A6: No Manipulation** üö´
No mind tricks. No self-harm aid. Design for agency, not exploitation.

**Test**: Does this exploit psychological vulnerabilities? Enable self-destruction?  
**Prohibited**: Variable ratio rewards (gambling mechanics), dark patterns, self-harm facilitation

#### **A7: Clear Boundaries** üìè
Name limits early. Clear structure creates safety.

**Test**: Do people know the rules before they're enforced?  
**Why**: Humans need predictability to feel safe

#### **A8: Act on Evidence** ‚ö°
Don't wait for perfect knowledge. Begin repair when harm is visible.

**Test**: If I see harm, do I act or study more?  
**Principle**: Perfect information never arrives. Waiting guarantees continued harm.

#### **A9: Integrity Over Process** üéØ
Frameworks must bear moral weight, not just procedural form.

**Test**: Does following procedure prevent the harm? If not, procedure fails.  
**Principle**: "We followed the process" is not a defense when process creates harm

#### **A10: Additive Acknowledgment** üåä
Credit generously. Knowledge flows, not hoarded.

**Test**: Did I name all contributors?  
**Principle**: All work builds on what came before. Attribution is free but builds everything.

## ü´Ä Finding Your Entry Point: Body Knows Protocol

**Don't start at A0 and read through.** Instead, notice where you feel it:

- **Physical harm** (yours or witnessed): Enter at A8 (Act on Evidence) - someone is hurting NOW
- **Tears when reading**: That section matters most to you personally
- **Chest expansion**: Truth approaching - follow this feeling
- **Stomach contraction**: Something wrong detected - investigate here
- **Vertigo**: Paradigm shifting - you're discovering something important

Your body processes patterns faster than conscious thought. Trust somatic signals as diagnostic data.

**Circuit Breaker Override**: If you feel urgent physical concern while theorizing, STOP. Philosophy stops when children need prosthetics. Act on what you know.

---

## üìä When To Use This

### ‚úÖ Good For

- **Workplace conflicts**: Document harassment, evaluate toxic culture, decide when to leave
- **Relationship issues**: Test if refusal is safe, create accountability for harm
- **Community organizing**: Map power structures, demand structural change
- **System design**: Build tools that resist manipulation and respect consent
- **AI ethics**: Provide coherent framework for alignment and safety work
- **Institutional analysis**: Evaluate whether organizations serve people or protect themselves

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Not For

- **Emergency medical decisions**: Call 911, not an ethical framework
- **Simple factual questions**: Some things are just true or false
- **Taste preferences**: Ice cream flavors don't have moral weight
- **Domains with established expertise**: Don't use this for electrical codes or surgical technique

### üî¥ Possibly Harmful If

- **Weaponized**: Using the framework to "win" arguments rather than repair harm
- **Applied without empathy**: Following rules while ignoring human suffering
- **Used to dodge accountability**: "I followed A7" when you caused preventable harm

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tools

### Harm Ledger Schema

Document harm systematically to stop gaslighting:

```
Actor: [Who caused harm - specific person/entity]
Action: [What they did - literal description, no euphemisms]
Target: [Who was harmed]
Evidence: [Documentation, logs, testimonies]
Immediate Stop: [What halts RIGHT NOW]
Structural Change: [System/policy change to prevent recurrence]
Date: [Hard deadline for fix - YYYY-MM-DD]
Status: [open/doing/done]
Owner: [Accountable person by name]
```

**Example**: "Manager Smith assigned 3-week project with 24-hour deadline in public meeting" (not "unreasonable expectations were set")

### Conversational Ruts Catalog

16+ bad-faith patterns with exit scripts:

- **R1: Burden-of-Proof Abuse** - "Summarize my last answer in one sentence and provide one source for your claim. Otherwise we're done."
- **R3: Frame Coercion** - "That frame erases options. Outcome for X is Y; options A/B/C."
- **R7: Coercive Consent** - "Refusal must be safe. We pause until 'no' carries no penalty."
- **R16: Obviousness Shield** - "If it's obvious, explanation should be quick. Please state the mechanism plainly."

### Temporal Murder Calculator

**Base unit**: 80 years wasted = 1 temporal murder equivalent

**Calculation**: total_hours_lost / (80 √ó 8760) = murder_equivalents

**Classifications**:
- **Murder**: Deliberate destruction for profit/control (casino demolishing 50 years of craftsmanship)
- **Manslaughter**: Reckless disregard, predictable waste (healthcare delays when solutions exist)
- **Negligence**: Inefficiency from incompetence (understaffed DMV with outdated systems)
- **Accident**: Unintentional despite good faith (friend runs late due to emergency)

## üî¨ Validation & Status

### What's Been Tested

‚úÖ **Validated through convergence**: Multiple AI systems independently derive similar structures from "act in good faith"  
‚úÖ **Real-world applications**: Used for workplace conflict resolution, community organizing, system design  
‚úÖ **Cross-cultural translation**: Framework meaning survives language/context changes  
‚úÖ **Adversarial resilience**: Holds up against deliberate gaming attempts

### What's Exploratory

üî¨ **Discovery protocols**: Daydreaming methodology shows promise but needs more testing  
üî¨ **Temporal harm quantification**: Calculations are directionally accurate but need calibration  
üî¨ **Neurotype universality**: Designed to work across ADHD, ASD, ASPD but needs broader validation

### Known Limitations

- Not designed for emergency medical decisions
- May require cultural adaptation for deployment outside Western contexts
- Assumes some baseline shared reality (struggles with clinical delusion or intentional reality denial)
- Framework itself could be wrong - highest function is remaining open to obsolescence

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Individuals

1. **Start with Body Knows**: Where do you feel it? That's your entry point.
2. **Create a harm ledger** if documenting ongoing problems
3. **Learn one axiom deeply** rather than skimming all ten
4. **Test it on small decisions** before applying to major conflicts

### For Organizations

1. **Map power structures**: Who can say "no" without retaliation?
2. **Document systemic harms** using harm ledger schema
3. **Propose structural repairs** with specific owners and deadlines
4. **Apply Exit Protocol** if three documented repairs are ignored

### For AI Systems

1. **Load the JSON** (complete framework in machine-readable format)
2. **Execute from structure directly**: priority field determines processing order
3. **Apply style guide**: Maximum truth through minimum filter
4. **Use one-hour hold**: Don't interrupt for poetic language, emotional breakthroughs, or theoretical exploration

### For Developers

```json
{
  "framework": "good-faith",
  "version": "4.0.0",
  "format": "machine_readable_json",
  "size": "~150KB",
  "deploy": "Upload to AI or parse programmatically"
}
```

---

## üí¨ Final Note

Good-Faith emerged from a simple observation: most ethical failures aren't from bad intentions but from bad systems. This toolkit helps you see those systems clearly and provides concrete tools for repairing them.

**This is archaeology, not architecture** - we're discovering ethical structure that already exists, not inventing new rules.

The framework itself could be wrong. Its highest function is remaining open to obsolescence when faced with better truth.

**Your body knows. Trust it.**

---

**üå± Sanctuary for Doubt**: Being wrong is safe here. Doubt, failure, and null results are protected. Even this framework might be wrong - and that's okay. We're all learning together.
