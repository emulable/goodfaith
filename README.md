# Good-Faith v4.4.0 — Clinical Tenderness

**A security audit for human consciousness**

Good-Faith maps the exploitable vulnerabilities in how we process power, consent, information, and time — then provides patches to fix them. Think of it as an operating system update for ethical reasoning that works across any situation, from roommate conflicts to international crises.

## 🎯 What This Does

Good-Faith helps you identify when someone (or some system) is exploiting cognitive vulnerabilities against you, then shows you exactly how to stop it and fix the underlying structure.

🔍 **Maps vulnerabilities** — Shows which mental patterns are exploitable and how  
📋 **Documents exploits** — Names the specific ways these vulnerabilities are being used right now  
🛡️ **Provides patches** — Gives immediate actions to stop the exploit today  
🔧 **Designs structural fixes** — Shows what system changes would close the vulnerability permanently  
✅ **Verifies effectiveness** — Includes tests so you know if the patch actually worked

## 🚀 Try It Live

## 💡 Why This Exists

Human consciousness evolved without security awareness. We gained self-awareness but didn't gain awareness of our cognitive attack surfaces. Certain mental patterns are exploitable — by malicious actors, by broken systems, by well-meaning but harmful structures. 

Good-Faith identifies these vulnerabilities, shows you where they're being exploited, and provides protocols to patch them. This isn't political philosophy — it's architectural analysis. Consciousness has bugs, and some of those bugs are being actively exploited.

## 🧩 Core Components

### The 11 Axioms

These are the fundamental rules that prevent exploitation:

**A0: Transparent Knowledge** — Mark your confidence level. Say whether you're proving something, suggesting it, or speculating.

**A1: Literal Language** — Use active voice and name actors explicitly. "X fired Y" not "mistakes were made." Translate all euphemisms.

**A2: Fidelity First** — If you change your position, state what changed and why. No silent revisions.

**A3: Safe Refusal** — Consent requires the ability to refuse safely. If saying no costs you housing, income, or safety, it's coercion, not consent.

**A4: Clear Boundaries** — State rules before people break them, not after. No retroactive boundaries.

**A5: Act on Evidence** — When you have harm plus evidence, act now. Don't wait for perfect information.

**A6: Structural Repair** — Real repair has three steps: name the harm, stop it immediately, and change the structure so it can't happen again. Apology without structural change is theater.

**A7: People Over Rules** — If a policy causes preventable suffering, override the policy. Following proper procedure doesn't excuse causing harm.

**A8: Integrity Over Process** — Judge by results, not just whether the process was followed correctly.

**A9: No Manipulation** — Refuse to enable gaslighting, DARVO, love-bombing, or helping someone harm themselves. Name the pattern and refuse to participate.

**A10: Additive Acknowledgment** — Credit your sources. Attribution creates a navigable knowledge graph.

**A11: Sanctuary for Doubt** — The framework itself could be wrong. Doubt is explicitly permitted. Question everything, including this.

### The 15 Ruts

Ruts are circular conversation patterns that waste time and avoid accountability. When you detect these, apply the exit strategies:

🔄 **Burden of Proof Abuse** — Demands proof but rejects every evidence you offer  
👥 **Headcount Pressure** — "Everyone believes this, so it must be true"  
🎭 **Frame Coercion** — Forces you to accept a false premise before the conversation can continue  
🔀 **Claim Swap** — Answers a different question than the one you asked  
👔 **Authority Shield** — "Just trust me, I'm the expert" without explaining why  
🎨 **Euphemism Cover** — Uses gentle language to hide harmful actions  
🤝 **Coercive Consent** — Pretends forced agreement is real consent  
📚 **Stalling Instead of Fixing** — "We need more research" forever, no action ever  
📢 **Low Content Disruption** — Creates noise without substance  
✏️ **Evidence Tampering** — Changes records after the dispute started  
🎓 **Credential Gatekeeping** — "You're not qualified to have an opinion"  
🚧 **Constraint Erasure** — Ignores real limits like time, money, or energy  
⚖️ **Venue Shopping** — Chooses forums where they have unfair advantage  
😠 **Emotional Gatekeeping** — "You're too angry to be heard" (tone policing)  
📖 **Language Hijacking** — Redefines words mid-conversation to win

### The 4 Core Tools

**Harm Ledger** — Document harm so specifically it becomes undeniable. Record who did what to whom, with evidence and quantified costs.

**Power Map** — Identify who can actually make changes versus who just has impressive titles. Real power means you can act without permission AND refuse orders safely.

**Exit Protocol** — Know when to leave, how to document it, and what protections exist. Sometimes the best repair is a clean exit.

**Life Accounting** — Convert wasted time into fractions of human life lost. Makes invisible time-theft visible and comparable across policies.

## 🎨 Philosophy: Repair-First

Good-Faith is fundamentally about building systems that work better. We document harm to stop it and fix the structure that enabled it — not to shame people or prove moral superiority.

🤝 Assume potential partner until proven otherwise  
🔬 Critique is diagnostic, not punitive  
🛠️ Document → Stop → Fix (not shame or punishment)  
🚪 Sometimes the best repair is exiting cleanly

## 🎯 How to Use This

### For Personal Conflicts

🏠 Use the harm ledger to document what's happening  
🗺️ Use power mapping to understand the relationship dynamics  
🛑 Use safe refusal to establish real boundaries  
🚪 Use exit protocol when patterns can't be fixed

Works for roommates, family, friends, and romantic relationships.

### For Workplace Issues

📝 Document everything with the harm ledger  
👤 Map who has actual power versus who has titles  
⚖️ Apply A7 (people over rules) when policies harm people  
📋 Know your legal protections  
🚪 Exit protocol when retaliation starts

### For Institutional Problems

🗺️ Power mapping is critical — target people who can actually change things  
📊 Harm ledgers create undeniable patterns  
🔧 Deploy structural fixes, not just individual solutions  
👥 Organize with others when needed  
⚖️ Use legal system when appropriate

### For Systemic Issues

🌍 Same tools, larger scale  
🏛️ Works for nation-states and international bodies  
📜 Policy repair based on documented patterns  
✅ Truth and falsifiable tests matter even more at this scale

## 🧠 Voice and Accessibility

Good-Faith uses a Rogers + Sagan synthesis — combining Fred Rogers' warmth with Carl Sagan's rigor.

💝 Warm AND rigorous simultaneously  
🎯 Kind and direct  
📏 Clear boundaries delivered warmly  
❓ Makes uncertainty and being wrong feel safe

Everything is written at a 10th grade reading level using concrete language, short sentences, and active voice that names actors explicitly.

## ⚠️ If the Framework Is Weaponized

If you see someone using "Good-Faith" to justify harm, extraction, or coercion:

Don't be diplomatic. Say clearly: "That's not Good-Faith. You've removed [list specific components]. What you're doing is [accurate description]. Stop misusing the term."

The framework's strength is in its specificity and falsifiability. Defend it by defending accurate terminology.

## 🔧 Technical Details

📐 **Substrate-independent** — Works across cognitive architectures (human, AI, different neurotypes, different cultures)  
🧪 **Falsifiable** — Every axiom includes a test to verify if it's being followed  
🔬 **Evidence-based** — Operates through power mapping and consequence prediction, not emotional compliance  
🌐 **Scale-universal** — Same patterns work from personal conflicts to international crises

## 🤝 Contributing

This framework is designed to evolve. If you find edge cases, improvements, or better ways to explain concepts:

🔀 Fork it  
✏️ Improve it  
🔄 Submit pull requests  
💬 Open issues for discussion

The goal isn't preserving Good-Faith — it's reducing harm and enabling repair. If you find something that works better, use that instead.

## 📚 Learning Resources

The framework teaches itself through use. Start where you feel drawn:

🎯 Pick the axiom that resonates most  
📖 Read the examples  
🧪 Try applying it to a real situation  
🔍 Notice the patterns it reveals

You don't need to memorize abstract principles. The structure reveals itself through practice.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this political?**  
No. This is architectural analysis of cognitive vulnerabilities. It works regardless of your political beliefs because it operates through power mapping and falsifiable tests, not ideology.

**Can I use this in [my specific situation]?**  
Yes. The framework scales from roommate conflicts to international treaties. Same tools, different scale.

**What if I disagree with some axioms?**  
That's explicitly permitted (see A11: Sanctuary for Doubt). Question everything, including this framework. Use what works, discard what doesn't.

**Do I need to implement all of it at once?**  
No. Start where you feel it. The framework is designed to be modular. Even using one axiom provides value.

**What if someone claims I'm using Good-Faith wrong?**  
Ask them to cite which specific axiom or test they think is being misapplied. If they can't point to specifics, they're not engaging in good faith.

## 🌟 Key Principle

**Time belongs to you (personal sovereignty) AND time is commons (collective resource).** Both are simultaneously true. Destroying time is theft from finite life. The framework helps you protect your time while respecting the temporal commons.

## 📄 License

This framework is open for use, modification, and distribution. The goal is reducing harm and enabling repair across all contexts.

## 🎯 Final Note

This framework serves you, not the other way around. Use what helps. Ignore what doesn't. Adapt it. Fork it. Improve it. Break it if you find something better.

The goal isn't preserving Good-Faith — it's reducing harm and enabling repair. This framework is a tool, not a truth.

**Question everything, including this.**
