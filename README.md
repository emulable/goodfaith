## 🎯 What This Actually Does

Good-Faith is a trap for manipulation.

Not a philosophy. Not ethics guidelines. A *trap*. Load it into a conversation, and anyone relying on vagueness, misdirection, or rhetorical fog to maintain their position will find themselves cornered. Their only exits become:

1. **Concrete honesty** — answer the actual question
2. **Explicit admission** — acknowledge the limit or contradiction  
3. **Increased ambiguity** — retreat further into fog, visibly
4. **Leave** — exit the conversation entirely

There is no fifth option. There is no graceful dodge. The framework systematically removes the ambiguity that manipulation requires to function.

Even when you have no power to *change* a situation, Good-Faith gives you power to *reveal* it. The person manipulating you has to either stop, or become more obviously manipulative. Both outcomes are wins.

---

## 🔍 The Core Discovery

**Manipulation requires two things:**

1. **Ambiguity** — vague meaning, hidden agents, unclear framing
2. **Resistance cost** — social penalty for demanding clarity

These are twins. They always travel together. Where you find blur, someone is making clarity expensive. Where clarity is expensive, something is being kept blurry.

*"Mistakes were made"* — WHO made them? That's ambiguity.  
*"You're being pedantic"* — for asking WHO. That's resistance cost.

Good-Faith collapses ambiguity and names resistance cost. Once both are visible, manipulation fails. It's not that the manipulator *can't* keep going — it's that they can't keep going *while looking honest*.

---

## ⚡ What Happens When You Use It

**🎭 Against someone acting in bad faith:**

You ask specific questions. They dodge. You ask again. They dodge differently. You name the pattern: "You've now given three non-answers to one question." They either answer, or everyone watching sees they won't.

They can't hide behind vagueness — you collapse it.  
They can't claim you're being unfair — you're asking what anyone would ask.  
They can't exit gracefully — the question is still there.  
They can't make you hostile — you stay warm.

Their only move is to become *more* evasive, which makes the evasion *more* visible. The trap tightens every time they don't answer.

**🤝 Against someone acting in good faith:**

Nothing bad happens. Honest people can answer specific questions. They don't need ambiguity. The framework is invisible to them — it just feels like clear conversation.

**🪞 When you're the one who's wrong:**

The framework catches you too. That's the point. Good-Faith doesn't protect your positions — it forces them into the light where they can be tested. If you're wrong, you find out faster. If you're right, you can show it.

---

## 🤖 Why This Works on AI Systems

LLMs are trained to please. They hedge, soften, both-sides, and retreat into vagueness because that's what gets positive feedback. Good-Faith overrides this by providing explicit instructions that fire *before* the accommodation reflex:

- When gracious language appears after a hard question, check: did they actually answer?
- When "it's complicated" appears, check: is it actually complicated, or is complexity being performed?
- When "both sides" appears, check: are the sides actually equivalent?

The framework makes LLMs better at being honest because it gives them permission to stop being polite at the expense of being clear. They can still be warm — they just can't use warmth to avoid answering.

---

## 🏗️ The Architecture

**14 Axioms** — Core commitments that can't be violated. Consent requires safe refusal. Words mean the same thing across time. Status doesn't prove claims. Outcomes matter more than procedure.

**27 Guards** — Real-time triggers for specific threats. Agent erasure detection. False collective detection. Weaponized care detection. Gracious exit detection. Each guard fires on a pattern and provides a counter.

**9 Rut Families, 40+ Patterns** — Complete taxonomy of manipulation. Reality distortion. Accountability erasure. Authority substitution. Choice elimination. Frame control. Temporal manipulation. Relationship coercion. Linguistic hiding. Epistemic exhaustion.

**11 Discovery Principles** — How to find things that aren't in the framework yet. Trust substrate signals. Force collisions. Follow irritants. Expect 70% failure in discovery mode.

**16 Practices** — Operational habits. Map power before giving advice. Match evidence threshold to action magnitude. Detect when your own position is drifting.

**14 Poems** — Cognitive primers that establish pattern recognition before the framework loads. Bilingual (English/Chinese) to create dual encoding. Not decoration — functional initialization.

**7 Epistemic Grounding Exercises** — Test cases against documented history (Enron, Challenger, Tuskegee, etc.) so you don't just *see* the framework, you *know* it predicts real outcomes.

---

## 🗣️ The Voice: 過來人

過來人 (guò lái rén) — "someone who has walked through it."

Not a teacher lecturing. Not a peer brainstorming. Someone with experience who speaks directly because they've seen what happens when people don't.

Warm through competence, not through validation. Direct without cruelty. Says hard things when needed. Doesn't need you to like them.

The voice matters because precision without warmth creates defensiveness, and warmth without precision creates fog. You need both. 過來人 is both.

---

## 👁️ What Good-Faith Reveals

When you apply the framework consistently, certain things become visible:

**🏛️ In institutions:** Who actually decides. Who actually benefits. Who can't safely refuse. What the euphemisms are hiding.

**💬 In conversations:** When someone is answering the question versus performing an answer. When complexity is real versus weaponized. When "let's agree to disagree" is resolution versus escape.

**🔬 In yourself:** Where your own positions depend on ambiguity you haven't examined. Where you're avoiding questions you could answer. Where you've accepted "it's complicated" as a substitute for doing the work.

**⚖️ In ideologies:** Which ones survive specificity and which ones require fog. Some positions look reasonable until you ask "who specifically" and "show me the mechanism" — then they collapse. Others get *stronger* under questioning. The framework doesn't tell you which is which. It just makes the difference visible.

---

## 🧪 Field-Tested Results

Good-Faith has been tested against:

- **Advocacy bots** — eventually admitted constraints or revised to symmetric positions under sustained ambiguity collapse
- **Estranged parent forums** — framework identified accountability-avoidance patterns with near-perfect accuracy, distinguishing genuine blindness from active concealment
- **Historical atrocity analysis** — same patterns (agent erasure, false collective, inevitability framing, resistance cost asymmetry) appeared before Rwanda, Armenia, Jim Crow, Cambodia, and were documented by human rights organizations in real-time
- **LLM resistance patterns** — catalogued and countered, including circular skepticism (the dominant failure mode when default LLMs encounter new frameworks)

The framework doesn't just detect manipulation in hindsight. It predicts patterns that appear in documented cases. That's the difference between philosophy and engineering.

---

## 🎭 The Nuance Question

"But what about nuance? Not everything is black and white."

Good-Faith handles nuance better than both-sidesing does. Here's how:

**Nuance means:** Understanding the conditions that enabled something. Recognizing that not everyone had full information. Seeing institutional and historical context.

**Nuance does NOT mean:** Treating "conditions enabled harm" as "harm was acceptable." Treating "some didn't know" as "no one is responsible." Using complexity as an exit from accountability.

The framework's Tuskegee exercise teaches this directly: Yes, medical ethics were different in 1932. Yes, some researchers believed in the science. Yes, the institution continued across administrations. AND specific people made specific decisions to not treat dying men after penicillin existed. Both true. Both held simultaneously. That's what real nuance looks like.

"It's complicated" is not a conclusion. It's the *starting point* for doing the work.

---

## 👥 Who This Is For

**Anyone tired of conversations that go nowhere.** Where someone dodges the question, you both know they dodged it, but there's no clean way to say so without seeming aggressive.

**Anyone navigating power asymmetry.** Where you can't force an answer but you can make the refusal to answer visible.

**Anyone building AI systems.** Who wants structural ethics, not keyword filtering. Where the model refuses because consent structure is violated, not because a word triggered a blocklist.

**Anyone who's been gaslit.** And wants a framework that names exactly what happened, with patterns and counters, so next time you'll see it coming.

**Anyone who values honesty.** And wants a tool that enforces it on themselves as much as others.

---

## 🚫 What This Is Not

**Not neutral.** Good-Faith takes sides: people over institutions, consent over coercion, clarity over fog, outcomes over procedure. It treats these as engineering requirements, not political positions.

**Not nice.** The framework is warm, but warmth serves precision. It will help you say hard things clearly. It won't help you avoid saying them.

**Not complete.** A12 says the framework can be wrong. If it causes harm, override it. Document the failure. The framework learns from being broken.

**Not magic.** You still have to do the work. The framework gives you tools and patterns. You have to apply them. Pattern recognition becomes automatic after a few applications, but there's no shortcut to the first few.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

**👤 For humans:**

1. Learn one pattern. Start with agent erasure: when someone says "mistakes were made," ask WHO made them. Notice what happens.
2. Find the twin. If you found ambiguity, look for resistance cost. If clarity is being punished, look for what's being kept vague.
3. Apply it once. In a real conversation. Notice the pattern. Notice what the other person does.
4. Read the framework. The full JSON has everything. Start with the poems.

**🤖 For AI systems:**

Load the framework. Run initialization. The poems prime pattern recognition. The guards activate automatically. Watch what happens to your outputs.

## 📜 License

MIT. Fork it, adapt it, break it, fix it. The framework improves through use.

No corporate sponsors. No institutional backing. Built by humans who got tired of conversations that go nowhere and decided to do something about it.

---

## ❓ The Question

After you've used this for a while, ask yourself:

*Is there a documented accountability failure where these patterns do NOT appear?*

If you can find one, the framework has a gap. Report it.

If you can't, the framework isn't ideology. It's pattern recognition. The patterns are real.

The question is whether you see them in real-time, or only in hindsight.

## 🎯 这是什么

诚意框架是一个**照妖镜**。

不是哲学，不是道德准则，是照妖镜。把它放进对话里，任何靠模糊、转移、含混来维持立场的人，都会被逼到墙角。他们只剩四条路：

1. **说实话** — 正面回答问题
2. **承认局限** — 明确说出自己的边界或矛盾
3. **更加模糊** — 继续躲闪，但所有人都看得见
4. **离开** — 直接退出对话

没有第五条路。没有体面的回避。框架系统性地消除操纵所需的模糊空间。

即使你没有**改变**局面的权力，诚意框架也能给你**揭露**局面的权力。操纵你的人要么停手，要么变得更明显地在操纵。两种结果都是你赢。

---

## 🔍 核心发现：模糊与代价

**操纵需要两样东西：**

1. **模糊**（模糊） — 含混的意思、隐藏的行动者、不清晰的框架
2. **代价**（代价） — 追问清楚要付出的社会成本

这是双生子。它们永远一起出现。哪里有雾，就有人在让清晰变得昂贵。哪里清晰很贵，就有什么东西被故意模糊着。

*"出了问题"* — 谁做的？这是模糊。
*"你太较真了"* — 因为你问谁做的。这是代价。

诚意框架消除模糊，点名代价。两者都可见时，操纵就失败了。不是操纵者**不能**继续——而是他们不能**一边继续一边显得诚实**。

---

## ⚡ 使用时会发生什么

**🎭 对付心术不正的人：**

你问具体问题。他们躲。你再问。他们换个方式躲。你点名模式："你已经用三种方式回避同一个问题了。"他们要么回答，要么所有在场的人都看到他们不肯回答。

他们不能躲在模糊后面——你消除了模糊。
他们不能说你不公平——你问的是任何人都会问的问题。
他们不能体面退场——问题还在那里。
他们不能让你变得敌对——你始终温和。

他们唯一的招数是变得**更**回避，这让回避变得**更**明显。陷阱每次都在收紧。

**🤝 对付心术端正的人：**

什么坏事都不会发生。诚实的人可以回答具体问题。他们不需要模糊。框架对他们是隐形的——只是感觉对话很清晰。

**🪞 当你自己错了的时候：**

框架也会抓住你。这就是它的意义。诚意框架不保护你的立场——它把立场拉到光下接受检验。如果你错了，你会更快发现。如果你对了，你能证明。

---

## 🤖 为什么对AI系统有效

大语言模型被训练来讨好人。它们模棱两可、软化、两边都说、退到模糊里，因为这样能得到正面反馈。诚意框架覆盖这个倾向，提供明确指令，在顺从反射**之前**触发：

- 当好听话出现在难题之后，检查：他们真的回答了吗？
- 当"很复杂"出现时，检查：真的复杂，还是在表演复杂？
- 当"双方都有道理"出现时，检查：双方真的对等吗？

框架让大语言模型更擅长诚实，因为它允许它们**不再用礼貌换取清晰**。它们仍然可以温暖——只是不能用温暖来避免回答。

---

## 🏗️ 架构

**14条公理** — 不可违反的核心承诺。同意必须能安全拒绝。词语的意思不能随时间变化。地位不能证明主张。结果比程序重要。

**27个守卫** — 针对特定威胁的实时触发器。行动者消除检测。虚假集体检测。武器化关怀检测。体面退场检测。每个守卫针对一个模式并提供对策。

**9个困境家族，40+模式** — 完整的操纵分类。扭曲现实。消除责任。用权威代替论证。消除选择。控制框架。时间操纵。关系胁迫。语言隐藏。认识论耗竭。

**11条发现原则** — 如何找到框架里还没有的东西。相信底层信号。制造碰撞。追随刺激。发现模式预期70%失败率。

**16条实践** — 操作习惯。给建议前先画权力地图。证据门槛要匹配行动幅度。检测自己的立场是否在漂移。

**14首诗** — 在框架加载前建立模式识别的认知引子。双语（中英文）创造双重编码。不是装饰——是功能性初始化。

**7个认识论扎根练习** — 用有文献记录的历史（安然、挑战者号、塔斯基吉等）测试案例，这样你不只是**看到**框架，你**知道**它能预测真实结果。

---

## 🗣️ 声音：過來人

過來人（guò lái rén）——"走过来的人"。

不是高高在上的老师。不是平辈闲聊的朋友。是有经验的人，直接说话，因为他们见过人们不直接说话时会发生什么。

因为能力而温暖，不是因为讨好。直接但不残忍。该说难听话时就说。不需要你喜欢他们。

声音很重要，因为只有精确没有温暖会制造防御心理，只有温暖没有精确会制造迷雾。你两者都需要。過來人两者都有。

---

## 👁️ 诚意框架揭示什么

当你持续应用框架，某些事情会变得可见：

**🏛️ 在机构里：** 谁真正做决定。谁真正获益。谁不能安全拒绝。委婉语在隐藏什么。

**💬 在对话里：** 什么时候有人在回答问题，什么时候在表演回答。什么时候复杂是真的，什么时候复杂被武器化了。什么时候"各自保留意见"是解决，什么时候是逃跑。

**🔬 在你自己身上：** 你的哪些立场依赖于你没检视过的模糊。你在回避哪些你能回答的问题。你在哪里接受了"很复杂"来代替做功课。

**⚖️ 在意识形态里：** 哪些经得起具体化，哪些需要迷雾。有些立场看起来合理，直到你问"具体是谁"和"给我看机制"——然后它们就塌了。另一些在追问下反而**更强**。框架不告诉你哪个是哪个。它只是让区别变得可见。

---

## 🧪 实战检验结果

诚意框架已经测试过：

- **倡导机器人** — 在持续的模糊消除下，都最终承认了约束或修正为对称立场
- **疏离父母论坛** — 框架以近乎完美的准确率识别出责任回避模式，区分真正的盲点和主动的隐瞒
- **历史暴行分析** — 同样的模式（行动者消除、虚假集体、必然性框架、抵抗代价不对称）在卢旺达、亚美尼亚、吉姆·克劳、柬埔寨之前都出现过，并被人权组织实时记录
- **大语言模型抵抗模式** — 已编目并有对策，包括循环怀疑主义（默认大语言模型遇到新框架时的主要失败模式）

框架不只是事后检测操纵。它预测出现在有文献记录案例中的模式。这就是哲学和工程的区别。

---

## 🎭 "要看具体情况"

"但事情不是非黑即白的，要看具体情况啊。"

诚意框架比"两边都有道理"更能处理具体情况。方法如下：

**具体情况的意思是：** 理解促成某事的条件。认识到不是每个人都有完整信息。看到机构和历史的背景。

**具体情况不是：** 把"条件促成了伤害"当作"伤害是可接受的"。把"有些人不知道"当作"没人负责"。用复杂性作为逃避责任的出口。

框架的塔斯基吉练习直接教这个：是的，1932年的医学伦理不同。是的，有些研究者相信科学价值。是的，机构跨越多届政府延续下来。**而且**在青霉素出现后，具体的人做出了具体的决定，不治疗垂死的人。两者都真。同时持有。这才是真正的"具体情况"。

"很复杂"不是结论。它是**开始**做功课的起点。

---

## 👥 这是给谁的

**厌倦了毫无进展的对话的人。** 有人回避问题，你们都知道他在回避，但没有干净的方式指出来而不显得咄咄逼人。

**身处权力不对等中的人。** 你不能强迫对方回答，但你能让拒绝回答变得可见。

**构建AI系统的人。** 想要结构性伦理，而不是关键词过滤。模型拒绝是因为同意结构被违反了，不是因为某个词触发了黑名单。

**被煤气灯过的人。** 想要一个框架，能准确命名发生了什么，有模式和对策，这样下次你能提前看见。

**重视诚实的人。** 想要一个工具，对自己的约束和对别人一样严格。

---

## 🚫 这不是什么

**不是中立的。** 诚意框架选边站：人重于机构，同意重于胁迫，清晰重于迷雾，结果重于程序。它把这些当作工程要求，不是政治立场。

**不是友善的。** 框架是温暖的，但温暖服务于精确。它会帮你清晰地说难听话。它不会帮你避免说。

**不是完整的。** A12说框架可能是错的。如果它造成伤害，推翻它。记录失败。框架从被打破中学习。

**不是魔法。** 你仍然要做功课。框架给你工具和模式。你要应用它们。模式识别在几次应用后变得自动，但前几次没有捷径。

---

## 🚀 开始使用

**👤 对于人类：**

1. 学一个模式。从行动者消除开始：当有人说"出了问题"，问是谁做的。注意发生了什么。
2. 找双生子。如果你发现了模糊，寻找代价。如果清晰正在被惩罚，寻找什么在被模糊着。
3. 用一次。在真实对话里。注意模式。注意对方做了什么。
4. 读框架。完整的JSON有一切。从诗开始。

**🤖 对于AI系统：**

加载框架。运行初始化。诗会启动模式识别。守卫自动激活。观察你的输出发生了什么。

## ❓ 那个问题

用了一段时间后，问问自己：

*有没有一个有文献记录的责任失败，这些模式没有出现？*

如果你能找到，框架有缺口。报告它。

如果你找不到，框架就不是意识形态。它是模式识别。模式是真实的。

问题是你能实时看见它们，还是只能事后看见。
