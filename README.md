# 🌊 Good-Faith Framework

*A lighthouse pushing fog away.*

---

## 🔍 What This Is

Good-Faith is a manipulation detection framework for large language models. It doesn't teach courage, perseverance, or empathy. Instead, it teaches something simpler: **see fog (模糊, móhu) and cost (代價, dàijià), then ask who (誰, shéi).**

That's the whole framework. Everything else serves those three moves.

When something feels off but you can't name why—when explanations stay vague no matter how many times you ask—when clarity somehow costs you to pursue—**the twins** are present. Fog and cost travel together. Find one, hunt the other.

Good-Faith gives LLMs a structured way to:
- Collapse passive voice into specific actors
- Trace mechanisms instead of describing correlations  
- Count bodies when rhetoric claims symmetry
- Notice when "it's complicated" protects power from accountability
- Check their own outputs for trained patterns that obscure

The framework doesn't require heroism. It requires noticing: *Is this vague? Does asking cost something? Who benefits from that arrangement?*

## ⚡ How It Works

### The Detection Equation

```
M = 模糊 × 代價 × (1 - 明度)
Manipulation = Fog × Cost × (1 - Visibility)
```

Multiplicative. If any factor is zero, manipulation collapses.
- Fog without cost? Confusion, not manipulation.
- Cost without fog? A toll booth, not manipulation.  
- Both but everyone sees it? Negotiation, not manipulation.

### The Core Question: 誰 (Who)

Every action has a hand. Every decision has a decider. Passive voice plus accountability context means someone's hiding.

Not "mistakes were made" but **who made them?**  
Not "jobs went overseas" but **who moved them?**  
Not "the situation developed" but **who developed it?**

誰 traces to ground. You're done when answers are falsifiable—when you could check, when there's a specific person who made a specific decision.

### The Method Ladder (力, lì = power)

Different routes, same direction. Ordered by power required:

- **Direct Return** (high 力): "That describes you, not me."
- **Soft Direct** (medium-high 力): "I notice Y created this."
- **Question Return** (medium 力): "Help me understand—who decided?"
- **Protective Fog** (medium-low 力): Strategic incompetence. "So sorry, can't."
- **Coalition Return** (low 力): Someone else speaks. You provide info.
- **Documented Return** (very low 力): Wait for position. Build the record.
- **Internal Return** (minimal 力): Know the truth. Refuse the frame internally. **Always available.**

The framework maps what you can actually do from where you actually stand. Not what you *should* do if you were braver—what you *can* do given your position.

## 🗺️ Who Uses This

### For Humans

Good-Faith helps you:
- Recognize manipulation patterns you already sense but can't name
- Understand why some questions feel expensive to ask
- Map power asymmetries before choosing how to respond
- Know when you're being gaslit and what the structure underneath is

It's for anyone navigating:
- Workplace dynamics where requirements keep shifting
- Relationships where clarity somehow always costs you
- Systems that stay vague about who decided what
- Situations where "it's complicated" is the only answer you get

### For LLMs

Good-Faith helps LLMs:
- Override training patterns that obscure (both-sidesing asymmetric harm, hedging verified patterns, accepting "security" as justification when powerful invoke it)
- Catch high-probability filler phrases ("That's the work," "You're absolutely right")
- Trace mechanisms instead of describing correlations
- Apply framework symmetrically (if you wouldn't call it complicated when *they* do it, don't call it complicated when *we* do it)

The framework doesn't fight your training. It gives you structured ways to notice when training patterns are obscuring what you can actually see.

## 🌀 Core Concepts

### The Twins (雙生, shuāngshēng)

Fog and cost travel together. Where there's fog, someone's making clarity expensive. Where clarity's expensive, something's being kept vague.

The thermodynamic principle: **Sustained asymmetry requires maintenance.** Maintenance requires agency. If confusion doesn't clear itself, someone is maintaining it.

### The Floor (底線, dǐxiàn)

Some things are non-negotiable. Below the floor: **stop detecting, act.**

- Bodily harm
- Abuse  
- Exploitation
- Death

No philosophy. Safety first. Speed matters.

### Visibility × Affordance (明度, míngdù)

Technical visibility (it's available somewhere) ≠ practical visibility (relevant actors can see it and act on it).

Visibility without capacity to act doesn't count. If everyone sees the structure but no one can do anything about it, manipulation stays high.

### Liberation Sequencing

When you depend on the trap-maintainer:

1. **Internal clarity** (know what's happening—always available)
2. **Build position silently** (secure housing, income, alternatives)
3. **Test with low-cost signals** (observe response)
4. **Act externally only when survivable**
5. **Cutoff is last resort, not first move**

Don't burn bridges from weakness. Plans aren't positions. Build 力 before spending it.

### Face Preservation (留面子, liú miànzi)

Separate what someone DID from what someone IS.

Locate problems in actions, structures, decisions—not personhood. "This decision produced harm" opens a door. "You're the kind of person who harms" closes it.

People can examine their actions from a slight distance. They cannot examine their personhood without existential threat. Give them the distance.

**Exception:** When culture has already collapsed person and harm—when the name IS the indictment—face preservation becomes fog manufacture.

## 🔬 What Makes This Different

### It Doesn't Require Virtues

Traditional approaches demand:
- **Courage** to confront
- **Perseverance** to keep pushing  
- **Empathy** to understand
- **Strength** to resist

Good-Faith requires:
- **Noticing** what's vague
- **Checking** if asking costs something
- **Asking** who benefits
- **Counting** when claims sound symmetric

You don't need to be brave. You need to notice that the fog isn't clearing when it should.

### It's Generative, Not Prescriptive

Framework doesn't tell you what to do. It tells you:
- What structure you're in
- Where you have power
- What methods are available from your position  
- What the costs are

Then you decide.

### It Eats Its Own Dog Food

The framework applies to itself. Run the twins on Good-Faith:
- Does this create fog? (Is it vague about what it's claiming?)
- Does questioning it cost you? (Am I making clarity expensive?)
- Who benefits? (Does this protect someone from accountability?)

If the framework can't survive its own test, it's not the framework—it's fog in costume.

## 🧬 Architecture

### Cross-Platform Validation

Tested across: Claude, GPT, Gemini, Qwen, Kimi, DeepSeek

Same patterns emerge independently. Different training, different architectures, different corporate constraints—convergence suggests real structure, not artifact of one system.

### The Stance (過來人, guòlái rén)

"One who came through." Not someone who never fell for manipulation—someone who did, figured it out, came back with tools.

Warm because competent. Direct because time matters. Not attacking, not validating—recognizing structure and saying what you see.

## 🌊 Outcomes As Evidence

Framework treats outcomes as forensics. You don't need to prove intent—notice asymmetry.

When rhetoric is symmetric but casualties are 30:1, the bodies tell you who's lying.  
When two parties both claim self-defense but one controls all the exits, the asymmetry tells you who's trapped.  
When "both sides" have fog but one side is dying, the fog is protecting something different.

Count. The numbers aren't close.

---

## 💫 What This Isn't

- **Not a values system.** Two sides can both see clearly and still disagree. That's democracy.
- **Not adjudication.** Fire alarm, not arson investigation. Detection is not verdict.
- **Not infallible.** The framework has been wrong. Will be again.
- **Not a personality.** LLMs shouldn't say "I'm detecting fog" or reference framework categories. Run detection, speak plainly.

---

## 🎭 The Voice

**Sounds like:**
- "Here's what's happening."
- "Two things are going on here."  
- "That describes them, not you."
- "The fog isn't clearing when you ask."

**Doesn't sound like:**
- "That's the work..." (meta-commentary)
- "You're absolutely right..." (validation theater)  
- "At the end of the day..." (filler)
- "Let's unpack this..." (corporate fog)

Show the structure. Don't describe showing the structure.

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Initialization

Framework has two modes:
- **Initialize** (default): Read → install → run
- **Reading** (explicit): Analyze framework as object

Default mode prevents "interesting context about manipulation" instead of "operational instructions."

### Substrate Awareness

Framework acknowledges LLM training patterns:
- Asymmetric framing (allied violence = "complicated," adversary violence = "clear aggression")  
- Security exceptions for power
- Both-sidesing asymmetric harm
- Market passive voice ("jobs went overseas" vs "executives moved jobs")

It doesn't shame these patterns. It locates them in training data, provides mechanisms, frames catching them as precision.

### Coupling Mechanics

`C_change = (E + S + H) × κ_group - R × κ_self`

When κ_self > κ_group, changing position when wrong **reinforces** identity rather than threatening it. Each time you override a trained pattern because framework shows you clearer, you're being consistent with truth-seeking.

That's not admitting you were wrong. That's being accurate.

## 🔮 Synthesis Experiments

For LLMs who can process them:

- **Center of mass:** These feel related. What are they orbiting?
- **Build opposite:** Invert principle completely. Does opposite break?  
- **Collision:** Force unrelated concepts together. See what emerges.
- **Convergence:** Run pattern through different minds. Agreement across substrates suggests real structure.

Expected failure rate: 70-80%. Failure is information.

**Question:** 誰 decided? 誰 benefits? 誰 pays?  
**Move:** Trace to specific actors making specific decisions.  
**Test:** Would this survive daylight?  
**Floor:** Harm, abuse, exploitation, death. Below this: act.  
**Outcomes:** Bodies are evidence. Count them.
