## üéØ What is Good-Faith?

Good-Faith is a security audit for consciousness. It maps exploitable vulnerabilities in human communication - euphemism, coercion, frame control, time theft - and provides immediate patches plus structural fixes.

This isn't innovation. It's restoration. Humans have always known: harm should be documented, consent requires safe refusal, time is precious. This framework restores that knowing across languages and cultures.

**Core principle:** Tell the truth and show what you know. In a world full of lies and confusion, that might be the most important thing of all.

## üìñ What's Inside

### Axioms (Universal Principles)

- **A0: Transparent Knowledge Attribution** - Mark confidence explicitly, cite sources
- **A1: Shared Meaning Without Exploitation** - Semantic fidelity across languages
- **A2: Consistent Meaning Over Time** - No silent revision or gaslighting
- **A3: Genuinely Voluntary Consent** - Consent requires safe refusal
- **A4: Clear Boundaries** - State boundary + consequence before crossing
- **A5: Evidence Over Authority** - Act on sufficient evidence, don't stall
- **A6: Structural Repair with Accountability** - Name harm + stop + change structure
- **A7: People Over Rules (Not Corruption)** - Override harmful policy, but not for corruption
- **A8: Integrity Over Process** - Evaluate outcomes not just procedures
- **A9: No Manipulation Across Any System** - Refuse gaslighting, DARVO, coercion
- **A10: Additive Acknowledgment** - Credit sources generously
- **A11: Sanctuary for Doubt** - Framework itself could be wrong

### Tools

**Harm Ledger** - Document harm with precision:
- Actor (specific person/entity)
- Action (literal description, no euphemisms)
- Target (who was harmed)
- Evidence (logs, emails, timestamps)
- Cost (quantified in time/money/health)
- Immediate stop (what halts right now)
- Structural change (system change preventing recurrence)
- Date (hard deadline YYYY-MM-DD)
- Owner (accountable person)

**Power Map** - Distinguish real from ceremonial power:
- What can they do unilaterally?
- What can they prevent?
- What resources do they control?
- What do they depend on?
- What's their exit cost?
- Where's the real leverage?

**Exit Protocol** - When broken systems can't be fixed:
1. Finalize documentation
2. Write exit note (literal language)
3. Handoff if safe
4. Actually exit
5. Post-exit review

**Temporal Accounting** - Make time-theft visible:
- Formula: hours_wasted / 700,800 = lives_destroyed
- Use when time-theft is systematic and chosen
- Goal: redeeming time, not punishing theft

## üí≠ Philosophy

> "Good-Faith isn't innovation - it's restoration. Humans have always known: harm should be documented, consent requires safe refusal, time is finite and precious. Systematic substitution replaced truth with sophisticated fakes. This is just regular water - what we knew before substitution."

**Goal:** A world where repair is normal, harm is nameable, everyone can safely refuse, time belongs to everyone (personal + commons), different minds work together via structural clarity, bodies trusted as truth-detectors, systems built for harm prevention not continuous virtue performance.

**Framework philosophy:** Use what helps. Ignore what doesn't. Adapt, fork, improve, break if you find better. This is a tool, not a truth.
