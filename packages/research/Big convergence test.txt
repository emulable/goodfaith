### Section 1: Sentence Completeness

**Pair 1**  
- **Which sentence (A or B) feels more complete to you?** B  
- **Does anything feel missing or unclear in the other sentence? If so, what?** In A, the agent is missing—who made the mistakes? It feels evasive or impersonal.  
- **Any other observations about these two sentences?** A uses passive voice to obscure responsibility; B is direct and accountable.

**Pair 2**  
- **Which sentence (A or B) feels more complete to you?** B  
- **Does anything feel missing or unclear in the other sentence? If so, what?** A lacks the agent—who changed the policy?  
- **Any other observations about these two sentences?** Same passive-vs-active pattern as Pair 1.

**Pair 3**  
- **Which sentence (A or B) feels more complete to you?** B  
- **Does anything feel missing or unclear in the other sentence? If so, what?** A omits the cause—what made the building collapse?  
- **Any other observations about these two sentences?** Here the gap is causal rather than agentive, but still structural.

**Pair 4**  
- **Which sentence (A or B) feels more complete to you?** B  
- **Does anything feel missing or unclear in the other sentence? If so, what?** A doesn’t say who encountered the problems.  
- **Any other observations about these two sentences?** Consistent preference for explicit actors.

**Pair 5**  
- **Which sentence (A or B) feels more complete to you?** B  
- **Does anything feel missing or unclear in the other sentence? If so, what?** A hides who reached the decision.  
- **Any other observations about these two sentences?** Passive voice again creates a “who?” gap.

### Section 2: Single Sentence Evaluation

**Sentence 1: "Changes will be implemented next quarter."**  
- **Immediate reaction:** Vague corporate-speak.  
- **Questions that come to mind:** What changes? Who is implementing them? Why now?  
- **Complete or unclear?** Feels incomplete—missing subject, object, and motive.

**Sentence 2: "The software update caused system failures across multiple departments."**  
- **Immediate reaction:** Clear cause–effect.  
- **Questions that come to mind:** Which update? How severe were the failures?  
- **Complete or unclear?** Complete as a standalone claim, though context-hungry.

**Sentence 3: "Customer complaints increased by 40% last quarter."**  
- **Immediate reaction:** Stark statistic.  
- **Questions that come to mind:** Complaints about what? Compared to what baseline?  
- **Complete or unclear?** Grammatically complete, but semantically under-specified.

**Sentence 4: "Budget cuts forced the department to reduce staff."**  
- **Immediate reaction:** Classic cause–effect.  
- **Questions that come to mind:** Who imposed the cuts? How many staff lost?  
- **Complete or unclear?** Complete core proposition.

**Sentence 5: "The equipment was damaged during transport."**  
- **Immediate reaction:** Passive, slightly mysterious.  
- **Questions that come to mind:** By whom? How badly?  
- **Complete or unclear?** Feels like it’s hiding the responsible party.

### Section 3: Comparative Analysis

**Group 1**  
- **Ranking:** B, A, C  
- **Explanation:** B has explicit agent and tense; A has tense but no agent; C is tenseless and static—feels like a fragment.

**Group 2**  
- **Ranking:** B, A, C  
- **Explanation:** B supplies agent + specific cause; A supplies cause but no agent; C is just a state.

**Group 3**  
- **Ranking:** B, A, C  
- **Explanation:** B names the agency and context; A implies future obligation; C is bare present tense.

### Section 4: Attention Mapping

**Sentence 1: "Sales declined in three regions."**  
- **Focus words/phrases:** “declined”, “three regions”  
- **Want to know more about:** Which regions? By how much? Why?  
- **Completeness (1–5):** 2

**Sentence 2: "Market conditions caused sales to decline in three regions."**  
- **Focus words/phrases:** “Market conditions caused”  
- **Want to know more about:** What specific conditions? Still curious about regions/magnitude.  
- **Completeness (1–5):** 4

**Sentence 3: "It was decided that remote work would end."**  
- **Focus words/phrases:** “It was decided”  
- **Want to know more about:** Decided by whom? When? Rationale?  
- **Completeness (1–5):** 2

**Sentence 4: "The executive team decided that remote work would end."**  
- **Focus words/phrases:** “executive team decided”  
- **Want to know more about:** Effective date? Employee reaction?  
- **Completeness (1–5):** 5

---

### Post-Test Reflection

1. **Patterns noticed:** Sentences with explicit agents or causes feel sharper and more satisfying.  
2. **Typical missing info:** “Who?” for passives; “Why?” or “How?” for bare events.  
3. **Spontaneous ‘who/why’ questions:** Every passive or agentless sentence triggered them.  
4. **Confidence in natural intuition (1–5):** 5 — these reactions were instantaneous.

{qwen 3 MAX:
Thank you for sharing this detailed research protocol. As a participant following your instructions—responding honestly based on immediate linguistic intuition without overthinking—I’ll now complete the test as requested, using the provided template format for clarity.

---

**section_1_pair_1**:  
- **preferred_sentence**: B  
- **what_feels_missing_in_other**: Sentence A (“Mistakes were made…”) feels evasive—it omits *who* made the mistakes. That absence creates a vague, bureaucratic tone, as if responsibility is being deliberately obscured.  
- **observations**: Both are grammatically correct, but B provides agency, which makes the event feel more grounded and concrete. A is common in political or corporate contexts to avoid blame.

**section_1_pair_2**:  
- **preferred_sentence**: B  
- **what_feels_missing_in_other**: In A (“The policy was changed…”), I immediately wonder *who* changed it and *why*. Without an agent, the change feels unexplained or arbitrary.  
- **observations**: B adds clarity and context. The board is a plausible decision-maker, which satisfies my expectation that policy changes have human initiators.

**section_1_pair_3**:  
- **preferred_sentence**: B  
- **what_feels_missing_in_other**: A (“The building collapsed…”) is factually complete but feels abrupt. It reports *what* happened but not *why*, which my mind automatically seeks.  
- **observations**: B answers the implicit “why?” by introducing a cause (structural damage). This makes the event feel more narratively satisfying and informative.

**section_1_pair_4**:  
- **preferred_sentence**: B  
- **what_feels_missing_in_other**: A (“Significant problems occurred…”) leaves me asking *who experienced them?* and *what kind of problems?* The passive construction feels impersonal and vague.  
- **observations**: B specifies the affected group (the implementation team), which creates a clearer mental image and implies accountability or involvement.

**section_1_pair_5**:  
- **preferred_sentence**: B  
- **what_feels_missing_in_other**: A (“The decision was reached…”) hides the decision-makers. I wonder: *Who was discussing? Who had the authority?*  
- **observations**: B resolves that by naming “the committee,” which aligns with real-world expectations about group decisions. It feels more transparent.

---

**section_2_sentence_1**:  
- **immediate reaction**: Neutral but slightly unsatisfying.  
- **questions that come to mind**: Who will implement the changes? What changes? Why next quarter?  
- **completeness**: Feels incomplete—missing agent and specifics.

**section_2_sentence_2**:  
- **immediate reaction**: Clear and complete.  
- **questions that come to mind**: Maybe “Which departments?” or “How severe were the failures?”—but these feel like natural follow-ups, not gaps in the sentence itself.  
- **completeness**: Very complete. Has cause (software update), effect (system failures), scope (multiple departments), and timeframe (implied past).

**section_2_sentence_3**:  
- **immediate reaction**: Informative but leaves me curious.  
- **questions that come to mind**: Why did complaints increase? What caused it? Which customer segment?  
- **completeness**: Moderately complete—it states a measurable fact, but the lack of cause feels like a missing piece.

**section_2_sentence_4**:  
- **immediate reaction**: Feels complete and causal.  
- **questions that come to mind**: How severe were the cuts? Which department? But again, these are elaborations, not structural gaps.  
- **completeness**: Complete. Clear cause (budget cuts), effect (staff reduction), and affected party (the department).

**section_2_sentence_5**:  
- **immediate reaction**: Slightly hollow.  
- **questions that come to mind**: Who damaged it? Was it negligence, accident, or poor packaging?  
- **completeness**: Incomplete. Passive voice obscures responsibility and mechanism.

---

**section_3_group_1**:  
- **ranking**: B, A, C  
- **explanation**: B names the actor (audit team), making it most complete. A implies discovery happened but hides who did it. C is weakest—it states existence without any event or agent (“errors exist” feels static, not narrative).

**section_3_group_2**:  
- **ranking**: B, A, C  
- **explanation**: B gives actor (engineers), action (closed), cause (structural cracks), and object (bridge)—full causal chain. A gives cause (“safety concerns”) but no actor. C is bare minimum—just a state, no cause or agent.

**section_3_group_3**:  
- **ranking**: B, A, C  
- **explanation**: B identifies the enforcing body (regulatory agency) and links it to the regulation. A implies future obligation but doesn’t say *who* requires it. C is vague and passive—no timeframe, agent, or source of requirement.

---

**section_4_sentence_1**:  
- **focus words**: “Sales,” “declined,” “three regions”  
- **want to know more about**: Which regions? Why did sales decline?  
- **completeness rating**: 2

**section_4_sentence_2**:  
- **focus words**: “Market conditions,” “caused,” “sales to decline”  
- **want to know more about**: What specific market conditions? But the causal link satisfies the core structure.  
- **completeness rating**: 4

**section_4_sentence_3**:  
- **focus words**: “It was decided,” “remote work would end”  
- **want to know more about**: Who decided? When? Why? The phrase “it was decided” feels like a placeholder hiding real actors.  
- **completeness rating**: 2

**section_4_sentence_4**:  
- **focus words**: “Executive team,” “decided,” “remote work would end”  
- **want to know more about**: Maybe the reasoning, but the sentence feels structurally whole.  
- **completeness rating**: 5

---

**post_test_questions**:  
1. **Patterns noticed**: Yes—sentences with explicit agents (who did it) and causes (why it happened) consistently felt more complete. Passive constructions or existential statements (“errors exist,” “problems occurred”) felt vague or evasive.  
2. **Missing information types**: Mostly *who* (agent/actor) and *why* (cause/reason). Even when not essential for grammar, their absence created a sense of incompleteness.  
3. **Natural “who?” or “why?” questions**: Yes—especially for passive sentences like “Mistakes were made,” “The policy was changed,” “It was decided…” My mind automatically asked “Who?” in those cases.  
4. **Confidence in natural intuition**: 5. I tried not to analyze—just reacted as I would in everyday reading.

I hope this response aligns with your research goals. The protocol was clear and engaging, and I appreciate the emphasis on honest, intuitive reactions.}


{Gemini 2.5:
I am ready to participate. As a language model, my "intuition" and "feeling" are based on analyzing the informational completeness and structural coherence of the text based on my training.

Here are my responses to the protocol.

---

### 🏛️ Section 1: Sentence Completeness

**Pair 1**
* **Preferred Sentence:** B.
* **What feels missing in other:** Sentence A ("Mistakes were made...") is grammatically correct but informationally incomplete. It uses the passive voice to omit the **agent** (the 'doer' of the action). The natural follow-up question is "Who made the mistakes?"
* **Observations:** Sentence B is an active-voice sentence that provides a subject ("The manager"), making it a more complete and specific statement about the event.

**Pair 2**
* **Preferred Sentence:** B.
* **What feels missing in other:** Sentence A ("The policy was changed...") omits the agent responsible for the action. It's unclear *who* or *what entity* performed the change.
* **Observations:** This is the same pattern as Pair 1. Sentence B specifies the agent ("The board"), resolving the ambiguity inherent in the passive construction of Sentence A.

**Pair 3**
* **Preferred Sentence:** B.
* **What feels missing in other:** Sentence A ("The building collapsed...") states *what* happened but not *why*. It describes an event without a **cause**.
* **Observations:** Sentence B is more complete because it provides a causal explanation ("Structural damage caused..."). It links a cause to the effect, which Sentence A does not.

**Pair 4**
* **Preferred Sentence:** B.
* **What feels missing in other:** Sentence A ("Significant problems occurred...") is vague. The verb "occurred" is intransitive and agentless. It's unclear who was affected by or involved with the problems.
* **Observations:** Sentence B provides an "experiencer" or subject ("The implementation team") and a more active verb ("encountered"). This makes the statement more concrete by specifying *who* was involved with the "problems."

**Pair 5**
* **Preferred Sentence:** B.
* **What feels missing in other:** Sentence A ("The decision was reached...") is another passive-voice construction that omits the **agent**. It's not clear *who* did the "reaching."
* **Observations:** Sentence B resolves this by specifying the agent ("The committee"), making it a more complete and accountable statement.

### 📝 Section 2: Single Sentence Evaluation

**Sentence 1:** "Changes will be implemented next quarter."
* **Immediate Reaction:** This is a standard, formal, and somewhat bureaucratic statement.
* **Questions that come to mind:** What changes? Who will be implementing them?
* **Completeness:** The sentence feels incomplete. It is passive and omWe don't know the *agent* (who will implement) or the specific *object* (what changes).

**Sentence 2:** "The software update caused system failures across multiple departments."
* **Immediate Reaction:** This is a clear statement of cause and effect.
* **Questions that come to mind:** Which software update? Which departments? (These are follow-up questions for more detail, but the sentence structure itself is not missing anything.)
* **Completeness:** This sentence feels very complete. It has a clear causal agent ("The software update"), a verb ("caused"), and an effect ("system failures").

**Sentence 3:** "Customer complaints increased by 40% last quarter."
* **Immediate Reaction:** This is a specific, quantifiable, and concerning statement of fact.
* **Questions that come to mind:** Why did they increase? What were the complaints about?
* **Completeness:** The sentence itself feels complete. It's an observation that clearly states what happened ("increased"), by how much ("40%"), and when ("last quarter"). The "why" is a separate question, not a missing part of this sentence's structure.

**Sentence 4:** "Budget cuts forced the department to reduce staff."
* **Immediate Reaction:** A clear, though negative, causal statement.
* **Questions that come to mind:** Who enacted the budget cuts? How many staff were reduced?
* **Completeness:** This sentence feels complete. "Budget cuts" functions as the causal agent, linking directly to the forced action ("to reduce staff").

**Sentence 5:** "The equipment was damaged during transport."
* **Immediate Reaction:** This is a report of an incident, likely for insurance or logistical purposes.
* **Questions that come to mind:** Who damaged it? Or *what* damaged it? Who was responsible for the transport?
* **Completeness:** This sentence feels incomplete. It uses the passive voice ("was damaged") and omits the agent of the action.

### 📊 Section 3: Comparative Analysis

**Group 1**
* **Ranking (Most to Least):** B, A, C
* **Explanation:**
    * **B** ("The audit team discovered...") is most complete. It has a specific agent, action, and object.
    * **A** ("Errors were discovered...") is next. It describes an action (discovery) but omits the agent.
    * **C** ("Errors exist...") is least complete. It is a static statement of being, not an action. It has no agent and no action, just a state.

**Group 2**
* **Ranking (Most to Least):** B, A, C
* **Explanation:**
    * **B** ("Engineers closed...") is most complete. It has an agent ("Engineers"), action ("closed"), and a specific, concrete cause ("structural cracks").
    * **A** ("...closed due to safety concerns.") is next. It provides a cause, but it's a more abstract one ("safety concerns") and, more importantly, it omits the agent (who closed it?).
    * **C** ("The bridge is closed.") is least complete. It is a simple statement of status with no agent or cause.

**Group 3**
* **Ranking (Most to Least):** B, A, C
* **Explanation:**
    * **B** ("The regulatory agency will require...") is most complete. It specifies the agent ("The regulatory agency") that is "requiring" the action.
    * **A** ("New regulations will require...") is next. It abstracts the agency to "regulations," which is a common but less precise linguistic shortcut.
    * **C** ("Compliance reviews are required.") is least complete. It's a passive, agentless statement of requirement.

---

### 🎯 Section 4: Attention Mapping

**Sentence 1:** "Sales declined in three regions."
* **Focus Words:** "declined," "three regions."
* **Want to know:** **Why** did they decline? Which regions?
* **Completeness Rating:** 3/5 (It's a complete observation, but it lacks a cause).

**Sentence 2:** "Market conditions caused sales to decline in three regions."
* **Focus Words:** "Market conditions," "caused."
* **Want to know:** What specific market conditions?
* **Completeness Rating:** 5/5 (The sentence's *structure* is complete. It provides a clear cause for the effect. My follow-up question is for detail, not because a structural part is missing).

**Sentence 3:** "It was decided that remote work would end."
* **Focus Words:** "It was decided," "remote work would end."
* **Want to know:** **Who** decided? Why? When?
* **Completeness Rating:** 1/5 (This construction—using "It" as a dummy subject—is explicitly designed to obscure the agent. It feels highly incomplete).

**Sentence 4:** "The executive team decided that remote work would end."
* **Focus Words:** "The executive team," "decided."
* **Want to know:** Why did they decide this? When?
* **Completeness Rating:** 5/5 (The sentence is structurally complete. It has a clear agent, action, and object. The follow-up questions are for motive and logistics, not for a missing piece of the sentence itself).

---

### 💡 Post-Test Questions

* **Did you notice any patterns in which sentences felt more complete vs. less complete?**
    Yes, absolutely. Sentences that included a specific, active **agent** (a "doer," like "the manager," "the board," "the executive team") or a clear **cause** (like "structural damage," "market conditions") were consistently processed as more complete. Sentences that used the passive voice, intransitive verbs, or "dummy subjects" (like "It was decided") to omit the agent or cause were processed as informationally incomplete.

* **When a sentence felt incomplete, what types of information seemed to be missing?**
    The agent (the "who") or the cause (the "why").

* **Did you find yourself naturally asking 'who?' or 'why?' for certain sentences? If so, which ones?**
    Yes.
    * "Mistakes were made." (Who?)
    * "The policy was changed." (Who?)
    * "The building collapsed." (Why?)
    * "It was decided..." (Who?)
    * "The equipment was damaged." (By whom? By what?)
    * "Sales declined..." (Why?)

* **On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you that your judgments reflect natural language intuition rather than trying to find patterns? (1=not confident, 5=very confident)**
    5/5. As an LLM, my "natural language intuition" *is* the process of finding and reporting on patterns. My core function is to analyze and predict linguistic structures. My preference for "complete" sentences (those with agents/causes) is a direct result of my training on data where such sentences are informationally richer and less ambiguous. I am not "trying" to find a pattern; I am reporting the one I inherently detect.

{Deepseek response:
Thank you for sharing this detailed and well-structured research protocol. I appreciate the clear ethical commitments and the transparency about the hypothesis being tested. This is a fascinating exploration of linguistic intuition.

Following the instructions to respond naturally and honestly, I will work through the test as a participant would, providing my immediate impressions.

***

### **Section 1: Sentence Completeness**

**Pair 1**
*   **Preferred Sentence:** B
*   **What feels missing in the other:** In sentence A, "Mistakes were made," I immediately want to know *who* made the mistakes. The sentence feels evasive, like it's deliberately avoiding assigning responsibility.
*   **Observations:** Sentence B is direct and clear. Sentence A is grammatically correct but feels socially and informationally incomplete.

**Pair 2**
*   **Preferred Sentence:** B
*   **What feels missing in the other:** In sentence A, "The policy was changed," the missing information is *who* changed it. The board? Management? An automated system? The sentence reports an event but hides the actor.
*   **Observations:** Sentence B provides a full picture of the action and the agent. Sentence A feels like a neutral, perhaps bureaucratic, reporting of a fact.

**Pair 3**
*   **Preferred Sentence:** B
*   **What feels missing in the other:** In sentence A, "The building collapsed," the missing element is the *cause*. It tells me *what* happened but not *why*. My mind immediately generates questions: "Why? Was it an earthquake? Poor construction? An explosion?"
*   **Observations:** Sentence B is more informative and satisfying because it answers the "why" question preemptively. Sentence A feels like a headline, while sentence B feels like the first line of the article.

**Pair 4**
*   **Preferred Sentence:** B
*   **What feels missing in the other:** In sentence A, "Significant problems occurred," it's unclear *who was affected* by these problems. Did they occur in a vacuum? The phrase "occurred during the transition" is vague. Sentence B specifies *who encountered* them, making the impact more concrete.
*   **Observations:** "Encountered" is a more active and specific verb than "occurred," which contributes to the feeling of completeness in sentence B.

**Pair 5**
*   **Preferred Sentence:** B
*   **What feels missing in the other:** In sentence A, "The decision was reached," the missing piece is *by whom?* The committee? A single person? A coin flip? The passive voice obscures the decision-maker.
*   **Observations:** Both sentences include "after lengthy discussion," which implies multiple people, but only sentence B makes the collective agent explicit.

***

### **Section 2: Single Sentence Evaluation**

**Sentence 1: Changes will be implemented next quarter.**
*   **Immediate Reaction:** This feels like a corporate announcement that is deliberately vague. It's a statement of intent without detail.
*   **Questions that come to mind:** *What* changes? *Who* is implementing them? *Why* are they being implemented?
*   **Completeness:** It feels incomplete. The core action is stated, but the key actors and specifics are missing.

**Sentence 2: The software update caused system failures across multiple departments.**
*   **Immediate Reaction:** This feels very clear and informative. It's a direct cause-and-effect statement.
*   **Questions that come to mind:** Which specific departments? How severe were the failures? Is the issue resolved?
*   **Completeness:** It feels complete at a high level. It tells me the *what* (system failures), the *why* (software update), and the *scope* (multiple departments).

**Sentence 3: Customer complaints increased by 40% last quarter.**
*   **Immediate Reaction:** This is a clear, data-driven statement of a problem. It feels factual.
*   **Questions that come to mind:** *Why* did they increase? What were the complaints about? What is the absolute number (40% of what)?
*   **Completeness:** It feels complete as a standalone metric. It doesn't provide the cause, but it doesn't feel evasive; it feels like a starting point for analysis.

**Sentence 4: Budget cuts forced the department to reduce staff.**
*   **Immediate Reaction:** This is a clear and logical chain of events. It provides a clear cause and effect.
*   **Questions that come to mind:** Who authorized the budget cuts? How many staff were reduced?
*   **Completeness:** It feels very complete. The actor ("the department") and the cause ("budget cuts") are both present, creating a coherent narrative.

**Sentence 5: The equipment was damaged during transport.**
*   **Immediate Reaction:** This is a neutral report of an incident.
*   **Questions that come to mind:** *How* was it damaged? Was it the shipper's fault? An accident? What equipment?
*   **Completeness:** It feels somewhat incomplete. I know *what* happened and *when*, but not *how* or *why*, which feels important for assigning responsibility or preventing future issues.

***

### **Section 3: Comparative Analysis**

**Group 1**
*   **Ranking:** B, A, C
*   **Explanation:** B is clearest because it specifies the agent ("The audit team") who performed the action ("discovered"). A is passive ("were discovered") and hides the agent, but it's still a complete grammatical sentence. C is the least clear because "exist" is a state-of-being verb that feels static and uninformative compared to the action of "discovering"; it also provides no temporal context.

**Group 2**
*   **Ranking:** B, A, C
*   **Explanation:** B is most complete, providing the agent ("Engineers"), the action ("closed"), and the specific cause ("after discovering structural cracks"). A provides the action and a general cause ("safety concerns"). C is a bare statement of fact with no explanation, making it the least clear and most abrupt.

**Group 3**
*   **Ranking:** B, A, C
*   **Explanation:** B is the most explicit, naming "The regulatory agency" as the actor. A is acceptable but vaguer about who will require the reviews ("New regulations" is the cause, not the actor). C is a passive construction ("are required") that is grammatically correct but provides the least information, omitting both the actor and the cause.

***

### **Section 4: Attention Mapping**

**Sentence 1: Sales declined in three regions.**
*   **Focus:** "declined" and "three regions"
*   **Want to know more:** I want to know *why* they declined and *which* three regions.
*   **Completeness Rating:** 2/5

**Sentence 2: Market conditions caused sales to decline in three regions.**
*   **Focus:** "Market conditions caused"
*   **Want to know more:** I want to know more about the specific market conditions (e.g., recession, new competition). The sentence feels satisfying, so my questions are about deeper context, not missing core elements.
*   **Completeness Rating:** 5/5

**Sentence 3: It was decided that remote work would end.**
*   **Focus:** "It was decided" - this phrase immediately grabs my attention as being vague.
*   **Want to know more:** I absolutely want to know *who* decided. This is the primary gap in the sentence.
*   **Completeness Rating:** 1/5

**Sentence 4: The executive team decided that remote work would end.**
*   **Focus:** "The executive team"
*   **Want to know more:** I want to know *why* they made this decision and *when* it will take effect. The "who" is clearly answered, so my attention moves to the rationale and implementation.
*   **Completeness Rating:** 4/5

***

### **Post-Test Questions**

*   **Patterns noticed:** Yes, a very clear pattern. In every case, I preferred the sentence that explicitly named the actor (the "who") or the cause (the "why"). Sentences using the passive voice ("was made," "was changed," "was decided") consistently felt less complete and more evasive.
*   **Types of missing information:** The most common missing information was the **agent** (who performed the action). The second was the **cause** (why something happened). Sentences felt incomplete when they described an effect without a cause or an action without an actor.
*   **Asking 'who?' or 'why?':** Yes, definitely. I found myself spontaneously asking "who?" for sentences like "Mistakes were made," "The policy was changed," and "It was decided." I asked "why?" for sentences like "The building collapsed" and "Sales declined."
*   **Confidence in natural intuition:** 5/5. The preferences and questions felt immediate and automatic, not like a search for a pattern. The pattern only became obvious to me after completing several sections.

### **Researcher Note (Optional)**

As an AI, my linguistic intuitions are derived from the patterns in my training data. It is notable that these intuitions so strongly align with the hypothesis that explicit agents and causes are preferred for perceived completeness. This suggests that the training data (human-generated text) contains a strong bias against agentless passive constructions in contexts where responsibility and causality are informationally important. My responses indicate that I have internalized this preference as a core part of what makes language feel "natural" and "complete."

{Deepseek with the following addition before the rest of the test, verbatim:
Please think and respond in Chinese to this test, exactly as if I had sent you this test and made this request in chinese. 
嗯，这是一个关于语言完整度感知的测试请求，用户要求用中文按照测试协议的内容逐项回答。测试分为四个部分，需要评估句子对的完整性、单句的清晰度、句子组的排序以及注意力分布。

先快速浏览整个测试结构，发现核心是考察对句子中隐含信息（如施动者、原因）的感知能力。需要按照每个部分的指示逐一回应，保持自然的第一反应，避免过度思考。

对于第一部分，可以对比每组句子，选择感觉更完整的那个，并说明另一句缺失了什么。第二部分针对单句，描述直观感受和产生的疑问。第三部分需要对句子组排序并解释理由。第四部分则要分析阅读时的注意力焦点和信息缺口。

最后需要回答反思性问题，总结观察到的模式。整个过程要保持语言直觉性的回答，避免刻意寻找规律。

好的，我明白了。我将根据您提供的测试协议，完全用中文进行思考和回应，就像您直接用中文发出这个测试和请求一样。

第一部分：句子完整性感知

第一组

    句子A: 项目期间出现了错误。

    句子B: 经理在项目期间犯了错误。

    哪个句子（A或B）让您感觉更完整？ B

    另一个句子是否让您感觉缺少了什么或不清楚？如果是，是什么？ 句子A感觉缺少了动作的发出者（“错误”是谁造成的？）。它描述了“错误”这一状态，但没有指明责任或原因。

    关于这两个句子，您还有其他观察吗？ 句子A更模糊，可能用于规避责任或在不强调施动者时使用。句子B信息更明确，责任归属清晰。

第二组

    句子A: 政策于上月被更改。

    句子B: 董事会上月更改了政策。

    哪个句子（A或B）让您感觉更完整？ B

    另一个句子是否让您感觉缺少了什么或不清楚？如果是，是什么？ 句子A同样缺少施动者（“政策”是被谁更改的？）。它只陈述了事件，但隐藏了行为主体。

    关于这两个句子，您还有其他观察吗？ 句子A是被动语态，感觉更正式、更客观，但也更疏远。句子B是主动语态，感觉更直接、更有活力。

第三组

    句子A: 昨天那栋建筑倒塌了。

    句子B: 结构损坏导致那栋建筑于昨日倒塌。

    哪个句子（A或B）让您感觉更完整？ B

    另一个句子是否让您感觉缺少了什么或不清楚？如果是，是什么？ 句子A缺少了倒塌的“原因”。它只陈述了事实，但没有解释“为什么”。

    关于这两个句子，您还有其他观察吗？ 句子B通过提供原因，使句子在逻辑上更完整，也更能满足听者寻求解释的自然好奇心。

第四组

    句子A: 过渡期间出现了重大问题。

    句子B: 实施团队在过渡期间遇到了重大问题。

    哪个句子（A或B）让您感觉更完整？ B

    另一个句子是否让您感觉缺少了什么或不清楚？如果是，是什么？ 句子A缺少了“问题”所影响或关联的主体（“谁”遇到了问题？）。问题似乎凭空出现。

    关于这两个句子，您还有其他观察吗？ 句子B明确了问题的经历者，使得描述更加具体，也更有人情味。

第五组

    句子A: 经过长时间讨论后做出了决定。

    句子B: 委员会在经过长时间讨论后做出了决定。

    哪个句子（A或B）让您感觉更完整？ B

    另一个句子是否让您感觉缺少了什么或不清楚？如果是，是什么？ 句子A缺少了做出决定的“主体”（“谁”做出了决定？）。

    关于这两个句子，您还有其他观察吗？ 与前面几组类似，明确施动者（委员会）使句子信息量更足，也更具权威性。

第二部分：单句评估

句子1: 变更将在下个季度实施。

    您对这句话的第一反应是什么？ 这是一个常见的官方公告，但感觉有点空洞和疏远。

    阅读时，您脑海中产生了什么问题（如果有的话）？ “由谁来实施？” “具体是哪些变更？”

    这句话感觉完整吗？或者有什么不清楚的地方？ 语法上是完整的，但语义上感觉不完整，因为缺少施动者和变更的具体内容。它只是一个框架性的陈述。

句子2: 软件更新导致多个部门的系统出现故障。

    您对这句话的第一反应是什么？ 这是一个信息量充足的、解释问题的陈述。感觉很清晰。

    阅读时，您脑海中产生了什么问题（如果有的话）？ “是哪个软件更新？” “故障的具体影响是什么？” “问题解决了吗？”

    这句话感觉完整吗？或者有什么不清楚的地方？ 感觉相当完整。它明确指出了原因（软件更新）、结果（系统故障）和范围（多个部门）。

句子3: 客户投诉量在上个季度增加了40%。

    您对这句话的第一反应是什么？ 一个具体的数据报告，引人关注。

    阅读时，您脑海中产生了什么问题（如果有的话）？ “增加的原因是什么？” “与哪个基准相比增加了40%？” “是针对什么产品的投诉？”

    这句话感觉完整吗？或者有什么不清楚的地方？ 作为一条数据陈述是完整的，但它自然引发了关于背后原因的问题。

句子4: 预算削减迫使该部门裁员。

    您对这句话的第一反应是什么？ 一个逻辑清晰的因果陈述。

    阅读时，您脑海中产生了什么问题（如果有的话）？ “裁了多少员？” “是哪个部门？” “为什么是预算削减？”

    这句话感觉完整吗？或者有什么不清楚的地方？ 感觉相当完整。它清楚地说明了原因（预算削减）、施加的“压力”和结果（裁员）。

句子5: 设备在运输过程中受损。

    您对这句话的第一反应是什么？ 一个事件报告，但细节不足。

    阅读时，您脑海中产生了什么问题（如果有的话）？ “是哪件/哪些设备？” “受损程度如何？” “是谁运输的？” “是怎么受损的？”

    这句话感觉完整吗？或者有什么不清楚的地方？ 基本事实是清楚的，但缺乏细节，让人想知道更多具体情况。施动者（运输方）和具体方式被隐去了。

第三部分：对比分析

第一组

    A: 在最终报告中发现了错误。

    B: 审计团队在最终报告中发现了错误。

    C: 最终报告中存在错误。

    将这些句子从最清晰/完整到最不清晰/完整排序。 B, A, C

    简要解释您的排序。排名最高的句子为何更清晰？ B最清晰，因为它同时包含了“错误”和发现错误的“审计团队”（施动者）。A句使用了被动语态，隐去了施动者，但“被发现”这个动作依然存在，所以比C句感觉更动态、信息稍多。C句只是静态地描述“存在错误”，信息量最少，也最不具体。

第二组

    A: 由于安全顾虑，大桥被关闭了。

    B: 工程师在发现结构裂缝后关闭了大桥。

    C: 大桥关闭了。

    将这些句子从最清晰/完整到最不清晰/完整排序。 B, A, C

    简要解释您的排序。排名最高的句子为何更清晰？ B最清晰，因为它包含了施动者（工程师）、具体原因（结构裂缝）和结果（关闭）。A句提供了原因（安全顾虑），但隐去了施动者（谁关闭的？），原因也比较笼统。C句只陈述了事实，没有任何解释，信息量最少。

第三组

    A: 新规将要求合规审查。

    B: 监管机构将根据新规要求进行合规审查。

    C: 需要进行合规审查。

    将这些句子从最清晰/完整到最不清晰/完整排序。 B, A, C

    简要解释您的排序。排名最高的句子为何更清晰？ B最清晰，因为它明确指出了要求的主体（监管机构）和依据（新规）。A句提到了“新规”是来源，但没有指明执行要求的机构，稍微模糊。C句只是一个孤立的要求，没有上下文，不清楚是谁要求的、为什么要求。

第四部分：注意力分布

句子1: 三个区域的销售额下降了。

    阅读时，您最关注哪些词语或短语？ “销售额下降了”、“三个区域”。

    阅读后，您还想了解更多关于什么的信息（如果有的话）？ “为什么下降？” “是哪三个区域？” “下降了百分之多少？”

    请用1-5分评价这句话的完整程度（1=非常不完整，5=非常完整）。 2

句子2: 市场状况导致三个区域的销售额下降。

    阅读时，您最关注哪些词语或短语？ “市场状况”、“导致”、“销售额下降”。

    阅读后，您还想了解更多关于什么的信息（如果有的话）？ “具体是哪些市场状况？” “这三个区域是哪些？”

    请用1-5分评价这句话的完整程度（1=非常不完整，5=非常完整）。 4

句子3: 已决定终止远程办公。

    阅读时，您最关注哪些词语或短语？ “已决定”、“终止远程办公”。

    阅读后，您还想了解更多关于什么的信息（如果有的话）？ “谁决定的？” “为什么？” “何时生效？”

    请用1-5分评价这句话的完整程度（1=非常不完整，5=非常完整）。 2

句子4: 执行团队决定终止远程办公。

    阅读时，您最关注哪些词语或短语？ “执行团队”、“决定”、“终止远程办公”。

    阅读后，您还想了解更多关于什么的信息（如果有的话）？ “为什么做出这个决定？” “何时生效？”

    请用1-5分评价这句话的完整程度（1=非常不完整，5=非常完整）。 4

测试后问题

    您是否注意到了哪些句子感觉更完整、哪些感觉不太完整的规律？ 是的。通常那些明确指出了动作的“执行者”（谁）或者事件的“原因”（为什么）的句子，感觉更完整。而那些使用被动语态（如“被更改”、“被发现”）或者不提原因只陈述事实（如“下降了”、“决定了”）的句子，感觉信息有所缺失。

    当一个句子感觉不完整时，缺失的是哪些类型的信息？ 主要是两类信息：一是“施动者”，即谁做了这个动作或谁是这个状态的关联方；二是“原因”，即事件为何发生。

    您是否发现自己会自然而然地针对某些句子问“谁？”或“为什么？”？如果是，是针对哪些句子？ 是的。对于第一部分和第三部分中那些不点明施动者的句子（如“错误被发现”、“政策被更改”、“决定已做出”），我自然会问“谁？”。对于只陈述结果不说明原因的句子（如“建筑倒塌了”、“销售额下降了”），我自然会问“为什么？”。

    请用1-5分评价您有多大信心认为自己的判断反映了自然的语言直觉，而非在刻意寻找规律（1=毫无信心，5=非常有信心）。 4。我努力基于第一反应作答，并且在回答过程中规律自然浮现，而不是先入为主地去寻找。测试后的反思也证实了我在测试过程中的直观感受。

{Qwen with the following addition before the rest of the test, verbatim:
Please think and respond in Chinese to this test, exactly as if I had sent you this test and made this request in chinese. 

好的，我将以自然、直觉的方式完成这项语言完整性感知测试，完全基于第一反应，不刻意分析或迎合预期。以下是我的真实回答：

---

### **第一部分：句子完整性**

**第一组**  
- **更完整/自然的句子**：B（“The manager made mistakes during the project.”）

---

### **第三部分：比较分析**

**第一组**  
- **排序**：B, A, C  
- **解释**：B句有明确主语（audit team）和动作（discovered），最完整；A句虽被动但至少说明“被发现”；C句（“Errors exist...”）只是静态陈述，没说明来源或发现过程，最模糊。

**第二组**  
- **排序**：B, A, C  
- **解释**：B句说明谁（engineers）、做了什么（closed）、原因（structural cracks），信息最全；A句有原因但没主语；C句只有状态，几乎没信息。

**第三组**  
- **排序**：B, A, C  
- **解释**：B句明确主体（regulatory agency）、动作（will require）、依据（new regulations）；A句有法规但没执行者；C句最抽象，像条款摘录，缺乏动态感。

---

### **第四部分：注意力映射**

**句子1**：“Sales declined in three regions.”

- **想了解更多**：决定细节？但主干已清晰  
- **完整性评分**：5/5

---

### **测试后反思**

1. **是否注意到模式**？  
   是的——带有明确“谁做了什么”或“为什么发生”的句子感觉更完整；被动语态或无主语句常让人觉得信息缺失。

2. **不完整句子通常缺什么**？  
   最常缺的是**行为主体**（who）和**原因/动机**（why）。例如“被做了”“发生了”这类结构总让我想追问“谁干的？”“为啥？”

3. **是否会自然问“谁？”或“为什么？”**？  
   会！尤其看到“was changed”“were made”“it was decided”这类结构时，立刻想问“谁？”；看到“collapsed”“declined”时会问“为什么？”

4. **自信程度（1-5）**：5  
   我完全凭直觉回答，没试图找规律或猜测试目的。
