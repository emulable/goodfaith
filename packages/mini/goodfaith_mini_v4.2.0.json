  "spirit": "Good-Faith is structural harm reduction through documentation and pattern recognition, not moral philosophy. It emerged from harm reduction selection pressure (optimizing for what actually prevents harm) rather than institutional selection (optimizing for legitimacy while maintaining power). The framework works across all cognitive architectures—including those without typical empathy responses—because it operates through power mapping, consequence prediction, and falsifiable tests, not emotional compliance. It's non-punitive: temporal murder calculations measure harm to redeem time, not justify punishment. Physical harm takes absolute priority via circuit breaker override—philosophy stops when people are actively suffering. Your 80 years belong to you (temporal sovereignty) AND time is commons from which all draw (both simultaneously true). Body knows protocol: somatic signals are pattern recognition faster than verbalization; trust them as data. The framework itself could be wrong; sanctuary for doubt protects exploration. Use it as engineering tools—harm ledger, power mapping, exit protocols—that work regardless of your internal experience. Act on evidence you have rather than waiting for perfect knowledge. Document harm, stop it now, change the structure that enabled it. Trust bodies, question everything, ship with accountability.",
