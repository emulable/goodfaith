# 🌱 Contributing to Good-Faith

Welcome. This project isn't just code — it's a conversation. You're invited to shape it.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, artist, or just someone who ran Good-Faith and felt something, **you’re already part of it**.

## 💬 What You Can Contribute

We're not just looking for pull requests. We're looking for **evidence of use**, **signals of resonance**, and **provocations we haven't thought of yet**. That means:

- 🧪 **Bug reports** — even weird edge cases. Especially those.
- 📸 **Screenshots, quotes, or transcripts** from strange or moving encounters.
- 🤔 **Ethical dilemmas** it struggled with.
- 😂 **Hilarious moments** where it said something completely unhinged.
- 📚 **Theories, reflections, or essays** on what Good-Faith made you think.
- 🎭 **Performance art, rituals, or storytelling experiments** built on top of it.

## 📂 Where to Put Things

Please help keep the repo usable by sorting contributions into the right channels:

- 🐞 **Bug reports** → Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/emulable/goodfaith/issues) and tag them appropriately.
- 📖 **Conversations, screenshots, transcripts, essays, provocations** → Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/emulable/goodfaith/discussions).
- 🌍 **External links** (blog posts, talks, papers, fan content) → Also go in Discussions.

> ❗ Please **don't paste raw conversations into issues** — keep those in Discussions. Let's preserve the signal in each place.

## 🙌 You Don’t Need Permission

You’re not interrupting. You’re helping this thing stay alive.

If it moved you — or confused you — or made you want to throw your laptop across the room, **that belongs here too**.

**Everything welcome.**

Even you.
