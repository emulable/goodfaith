# ü§ù Contributing to Good-Faith

Welcome! We're glad you're interested in contributing to Good-Faith.

This framework grows through real-world use and collaborative discovery. Whether you've tested an axiom in the wild, found a new conversational rut, or just have a funny story about what happened when you applied Good-Faith to your morning coffee debate‚Äîwe want to hear it.

---

## üïµÔ∏è What We're Looking For

### üìä Real-World Testing
Applied Good-Faith to an actual situation? Tell us what happened:
- **Institutional analysis**: Used the framework to evaluate a policy or organization
- **Conversation navigation**: Escaped a bad-faith pattern using the ruts catalog
- **Decision-making**: Applied axioms to a real ethical dilemma
- **System design**: Built something with Good-Faith principles

We care most about **what worked, what didn't, and why**. Failures are as valuable as successes.

### üí≠ Thought Experiments
Tested the framework against hypothetical scenarios:
- Edge cases that strain the axioms
- Scenarios where multiple axioms conflict
- Cultural contexts where translation might need work
- Novel situations the framework doesn't currently handle well

### üìñ Anecdotes & Stories
Used Good-Faith in small ways:
- Applied it to a family discussion
- Caught yourself in a conversational rut
- Noticed temporal waste you hadn't seen before
- Had an "oh, that's what A4 means" moment in real life

### üòÇ Funny/Interesting Observations
- Framework behaving unexpectedly
- Surprising convergence between different applications
- Moments where Good-Faith revealed something absurd
- The comedy algorithm proving itself in the wild

### üî¨ Discovery Contributions
- New conversational ruts you've encountered
- Patterns that might become Thought Cabinet entries
- Connections between existing axioms you've noticed
- Failed experiments (seriously, we want these)

## üéØ What Makes a Good Contribution

**Be specific**: "I used A1 to analyze a TOS agreement" tells us more than "Good-Faith is useful."

**Include context**: What was the situation? What did you try? What happened?

**Show your work**: How did you apply the framework? What process did you follow?

**Be honest**: If something didn't work, say so. If you're uncertain, say that too.

**Respect privacy**: Anonymize real situations. Change identifying details.

---

## ‚úÖ Contribution Standards

### We Value
- **Intellectual honesty**: Admit uncertainties, report failures
- **Plain language**: Avoid jargon when possible
- **Concrete examples**: Specific beats abstract
- **Falsifiability**: State what would prove your finding wrong

### We Don't Need
- Perfect polish (rough drafts are fine)
- Academic credentials (insights matter, not titles)
- Agreement with everything (constructive critique is welcome)
- Lengthy preambles (get to the point)

---

## üö´ What We're Not Looking For

- **Weaponizing the framework** against individuals (naming them to shame rather than identify patterns)
- **Abstract philosophy debates** without practical application
- **Marketing material** or promotional content
- **Trivial applications** (ice cream flavor analysis, etc.)
- **Bad-faith contributions** (ironic, yes, but it happens)

---

## üß™ The Sanctuary for Doubt

This framework could be wrong. Your contribution might reveal that. **That's valuable.**

We maintain the Sanctuary for Doubt: being wrong here is safe. If your contribution reveals a flaw in the framework, that's a feature, not a bug. Document it thoroughly.

Target failure rate for discovery contributions: ~70%. If everything you try works, you're probably not exploring hard enough.

## üìã Example Contribution Formats

### Real-World Test
```markdown
## Used A1 (Safe Refusal) to evaluate workplace policy

**Context**: Company wanted mandatory weekend training with 48hr notice

**Application**: Asked "Can I safely refuse?" Answer was no‚Äîrefusal meant 
informal punishment (bad assignments, passed over for promotion)

**Result**: Policy violated A1. Presented analysis to HR. They implemented 
voluntary attendance with incentive pay instead.

**What worked**: Framework made invisible coercion visible
**What didn't**: Took 3 months to get change implemented
**Axioms involved**: A1, A3 (structural repair)
```

### Thought Experiment
```markdown
## Edge case: A4 vs A9 conflict in emergency medicine

**Scenario**: Doctor must choose between following protocol (A9) or 
breaking it to save patient (A4)

**Framework response**: A4 wins‚Äîpeople over rules. But A9 says integrity 
over process. Conflict?

**Resolution attempt**: A9 is about outcomes mattering more than 
compliance. If protocol produces harm, A4 and A9 align‚Äîbreak the 
protocol, fix the protocol.

**Remaining question**: What if protocol is actually correct but appears 
wrong in this specific case?
```

### Anecdote
```markdown
## Caught myself in R4 (Claim Swap) mid-argument

Was debating with friend about restaurant choice. Started with "This 
place has better food" then retreated to "Well, I just prefer the 
atmosphere."

Recognized R4 in real-time. Laughed. Admitted I didn't actually have 
evidence about food quality, just preferred vibe. Friend appreciated 
honesty. We picked third restaurant.

Small moment but framework made me notice my own bullshit.
```

- Whether your finding fits the framework

## üå± Why This Matters

Good-Faith grows through use. Every real-world test is data. Every anecdote reveals something. Every failed application shows us boundaries.

You're not just contributing to a framework‚Äîyou're helping discover ethical structure that already exists. We're all archaeologists here.

**This is archaeology, not architecture. Your shovel is welcome.**
