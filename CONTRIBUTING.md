# Contributing to Good-Faith Framework

## 🤝 Welcome Contributors

The Good-Faith Framework grows stronger through diverse perspectives and adversarial testing. Every contribution - whether it's finding edge cases where the framework fails, proposing new defensive patterns, or translating concepts for different cultures - makes the system more robust.

## 📋 Ways to Contribute

### 🔍 Testing & Validation
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Find situations where the framework breaks or produces harmful outcomes
- **Cultural Testing**: Validate that patterns work (or don't) in your cultural context
- **Neurodivergence Testing**: Check accessibility for different cognitive architectures
- **Professional Testing**: Apply framework in your field and document what works/fails

### 🛠️ Framework Development
- **New Rut Patterns**: Document manipulation patterns not yet captured
- **Exit Strategies**: Propose better escapes from conversational traps
- **Guard Improvements**: Strengthen detection of harmful patterns
- **Axiom Refinements**: Clarify or enhance core principles

### 🌍 Translation & Localization
- **Language Rerooting**: Not just translation - find concepts in your language that illuminate new ethical dimensions
- **Cultural Adversarial Modeling**: Map exploitation vectors specific to your culture
- **Metaphor Adaptation**: Replace metaphors that don't work in your context

### 📚 Documentation
- **Use Cases**: Document how you've applied the framework
- **Failure Analysis**: Write up cases where the framework failed (these are valuable!)
- **Integration Guides**: Show how to embed framework in different systems
- **Simplification**: Make complex concepts more accessible

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### For Code/Framework Changes

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emulable/goodfaith.git
   cd goodfaith
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-improvement
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing JSON structure for framework modifications
   - Update version number if adding new components
   - Document rationale for changes

4. **Test your changes**
   - Load modified framework into an AI system
   - Verify backward compatibility
   - Document any breaking changes

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Clear description of what changed and why
   - Include test results or validation
   - Reference any related issues

### For Documentation

1. **Identify gaps or improvements**
   - Missing use cases
   - Unclear explanations
   - Outdated examples

2. **Write in clear, direct language**
   - Avoid euphemisms (per A5)
   - Use concrete examples
   - Include both success and failure cases

3. **Submit via PR or Issue**
   - Small fixes: Direct PR
   - Large changes: Open issue for discussion first

### For Bug Reports

Create an issue with:
- **Context**: What were you trying to do?
- **Expected**: What should have happened?
- **Actual**: What actually happened?
- **Impact**: Who was harmed or what broke?
- **Environment**: What system/context?

## 🎯 Contribution Principles

### What Makes a Good Contribution

✅ **Adversarially tested** - You've tried to break it and documented how
✅ **Culturally aware** - Acknowledges that solutions aren't universal
✅ **Harm-reducing** - Demonstrably reduces potential for exploitation
✅ **Practically applicable** - Can be implemented, not just theoretical
✅ **Well-documented** - Others can understand and build on your work

### What to Avoid

❌ **Untested theory** - Ideas without implementation attempts
❌ **Universal claims** - "This works for everyone"
❌ **Complexity for its own sake** - Framework should remain usable
❌ **Euphemistic language** - Call things what they are
❌ **Single-culture focus** - Consider broader applicability

## 🔬 Testing Your Contributions

### Minimal Testing
1. Load into an AI system and verify it processes correctly
2. Test the specific scenario your change addresses
3. Verify no existing functionality breaks

### Thorough Testing
1. Test across multiple AI systems (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.)
2. Have others from different backgrounds test your changes
3. Document failure modes and edge cases
4. Test with adversarial users trying to exploit the system

## 📝 Code of Conduct

### Core Expectations

- **Practice A0**: Model how your contribution could fail
- **Practice A1**: Acknowledge when you might be wrong
- **Practice A6**: Respect consent - don't force changes on unwilling users
- **Practice A7**: Recognize systemic patterns, not just individual issues
- **Practice A8**: If you break something, help fix it

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Weaponizing the framework against vulnerable populations
- Adding complexity that serves institutional rather than human needs
- Introducing patterns that enable manipulation or coercion
- Claiming universal truth without evidence
- Dismissing cultural or neurodivergent perspectives

## 🏆 Recognition

Contributors who identify significant vulnerabilities, add major capabilities, or provide substantial translations will be recognized in:
- Release notes
- Contributors file
- Framework documentation (for major contributions)

## 💬 Getting Help

- **Questions**: Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/emulable/goodfaith/discussions)
- **Bugs**: Open an [Issue](https://github.com/emulable/goodfaith/issues)
- **Ideas**: Start with a Discussion, move to PR when ready
- **Cultural Consultation**: Tag issues with `cultural-review` for feedback

## 🔄 Review Process

### What We Look For

1. **Alignment with framework principles** - Does it support human dignity?
2. **Evidence of testing** - Has it been tried in practice?
3. **Documentation quality** - Can others understand and use it?
4. **Backward compatibility** - Does it break existing uses?
5. **Cultural applicability** - Is it accessible across contexts?

### Timeline

- Simple documentation fixes: 1-3 days
- New patterns or components: 1-2 weeks
- Major architectural changes: Requires discussion first
