# Hey! Want to help make Good-Faith better? üôå

We're so glad you're here! This project is all about building tools for honest conversation and fixing things that are broken. If that sounds good to you, we'd love your help.

## How you can contribute:

### üêõ Spot something off?
Found a typo, confusing explanation, or something that doesn't feel right?
- **Open an Issue** - just describe what you found
- Be specific: "On page X, the example Y seems confusing because Z"

### üí° Have a cool idea?
Thought of a new way to explain things or a real-world example?
- **Share it!** We love new perspectives
- Start small - even one clear example helps

### üåç Speak another language?
Help make Good-Faith accessible to more people!
- **Translate** parts of the framework
- Follow our "meaning over words" principle

### üß™ Used this in real life?
Tell us how it went! Success stories and "what I learned" help everyone.

1. **Be kind** - to others and to yourself
2. **Keep it clear** - plain language helps everyone
