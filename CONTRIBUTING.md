# 🤝 Contributing to Good-Faith

Welcome! We're glad you're here.

Good-Faith grows through real-world use and collaborative discovery. Whether you've tested an axiom in the wild, found a new conversational rut, documented a harm ledger for an actual situation, or just have a story about what happened when you tried using the framework—we want to hear it.

**You don't need to be an ethics expert.** You don't need a PhD. You don't need to have "significant" findings. Small observations matter. Failed experiments are valuable. Weird edge cases teach us boundaries.

---

## 🌟 What We're Looking For

### 📊 Real-World Testing

Applied Good-Faith to an actual situation? Tell us what happened:

- **Workplace scenarios**: Used harm ledger to document harassment, evaluated toxic culture, applied Exit Protocol
- **Relationship conflicts**: Tested A3 (Safe Refusal), created accountability for harm, navigated difficult conversations
- **Community organizing**: Mapped power structures, demanded structural repair, coordinated coalition using framework
- **System design**: Built tools with Good-Faith principles, tested manipulation resistance
- **Decision-making**: Applied axioms to real ethical dilemmas
- **Institutional analysis**: Evaluated organizations, policies, or systems

**We care about what worked, what didn't, and why.** Failures are as valuable as successes. "I tried X and it completely backfired because Y" is excellent data.

### 💭 Thought Experiments

Tested the framework against hypothetical scenarios:

- **Edge cases** that strain the axioms
- **Axiom conflicts** - situations where multiple axioms seem to contradict
- **Cultural contexts** where translation might need work
- **Novel situations** the framework doesn't currently handle well
- **Adversarial scenarios** - what happens if someone deliberately games this?

### 📖 Anecdotes & Stories

Used Good-Faith in small ways:

- Applied it to a family discussion
- Caught yourself in a conversational rut
- Noticed temporal waste you hadn't seen before
- Had an "oh, that's what A4 means" moment in real life
- Used Body Knows Protocol and it actually worked
- Witnessed physical harm and framework helped you act (or didn't)

**Small is fine.** "I used R7 (Coercive Consent) to recognize pressure in a sales situation" is a valid contribution.

### 🔍 Pattern Discoveries

Found something the framework doesn't currently capture:

- **New conversational ruts** you've encountered in the wild
- **Connections between axioms** you noticed
- **Deployment patterns** for specific domains
- **Failure modes** not yet documented
- **Cultural translation** insights
- **Temporal harm calculations** that need calibration

### 😂 Funny/Weird Observations

- Framework behaving unexpectedly
- Absurd conclusions when applied strictly to trivial situations
- AI systems interpreting Good-Faith in surprising ways
- Edge cases that reveal something about the framework's boundaries
- The comedy algorithm proving itself

**Example**: "I applied temporal murder calculation to waiting for my coffee and realized the barista committed 0.0000001 temporal murders. This is obviously ridiculous, which taught me the framework needs minimum significance thresholds."

### 🐛 Bug Reports

Found something wrong:

- **Documentation errors**: Typos, unclear explanations, broken links
- **Logical inconsistencies**: Axioms that seem to contradict
- **JSON schema issues**: Parsing problems, structural errors
- **Missing use cases**: Domains where framework should apply but guidance is absent
- **Harmful applications**: Ways the framework could be weaponized

### 📝 Documentation Improvements

- Clearer explanations of existing concepts
- More worked examples
- Better deployment blueprints
- Translations to other languages
- Accessibility improvements

### 🛠️ Code & Tooling

- Parsers for the JSON schema
- Web interfaces for harm ledger creation
- Decision tree implementations
- Conversational rut detection tools
- Temporal harm calculators
- Integration with other systems

## 🎯 What Makes a Good Contribution

### Be Specific

**Instead of**: "Good-Faith is useful for workplace issues"  
**Try**: "I used A3 (Safe Refusal) to recognize that declining extra projects would result in passive-aggressive treatment from my manager. This helped me see the consent violation clearly."

**Instead of**: "The framework has some problems"  
**Try**: "A5 (People Over Rules) and A7 (Clear Boundaries) seem to contradict when someone claims 'I'm breaking a harmful rule' but is actually just avoiding accountability. Need guidance for distinguishing genuine A5 situations from A5 weaponization."

### Include Context

**Essential context**:
- What was the situation?
- Which framework components did you use?
- What were you trying to accomplish?
- What actually happened?
- What did you learn?

**Good example**:
> "I used the harm ledger schema to document my manager's pattern of assigning deadline-impossible projects. Context: small team, tech startup, manager is founder's friend. Applied framework: Created ledger with 5 entries over 3 months, each with specific dates and witnesses. Outcome: When I presented the documented pattern, manager became defensive but couldn't deny the facts. Learning: Documentation stops gaslighting, but power asymmetries mean even good documentation doesn't guarantee structural change. I eventually invoked Exit Protocol."

### Show Your Work

If you're proposing a change or reporting a bug:
- **Quote the relevant section** from the framework
- **Explain why it's problematic** with specific reasoning
- **Propose an alternative** if you have one (but "I don't know the fix" is also fine)

### Acknowledge Uncertainty

Per A0 (Transparent Knowledge): Say what you know and where your knowledge ends.

**Good**: "I tested this with 3 friends in casual conversations. It worked in 2 cases, failed in 1. I don't know if this generalizes beyond my friend group."

**Bad**: "This always works for everyone in all situations."

### Welcome Your Own Doubt

Per Sanctuary for Doubt: Being wrong is safe here.

**It's okay to say**:
- "I might be misunderstanding A4"
- "This could be a bad interpretation"
- "I'm not sure this is even a problem"
- "Maybe I'm wrong about this"

## 🔧 Framework-Specific Guidance

### Documenting Harm Ledger Examples

If you're sharing a real harm ledger (anonymized):

**Must include** (per schema):
- Actor (who caused harm)
- Action (what they did - use literal language per A1)
- Target (who was harmed)
- Evidence (what proves it happened)
- Immediate stop (what halted right away)
- Structural change (what changed to prevent recurrence)
- Date (deadline for fix)
- Status (open/doing/done)
- Owner (who's accountable)

**Privacy considerations**:
- Anonymize names unless public figures
- Remove identifying details that could expose vulnerable people
- Note "anonymized for privacy" so readers know context
- Consider using "Company X" or "Manager Y" style placeholders

### Noting Which Axioms Applied

Help us see patterns by tagging which parts of framework were relevant:

- **Axioms**: A0-A10
- **Seeds**: Seed 1 (honesty), Seed 2 (good faith), Seed 3 (time)
- **Tools**: Harm Ledger, Conversational Ruts, Temporal Calculator, Body Knows
- **Protocols**: Exit Protocol, Durable Repair, Circuit Breaker Override

**Example**: "This situation involved A3 (Safe Refusal) violation, R7 (Coercive Consent) pattern, and eventually triggered Exit Protocol."

### Describing Failure Modes

When framework didn't work:

**Useful information**:
- What did you try to do?
- Which framework components did you apply?
- What went wrong?
- Why do you think it failed?
- What would have worked better?

**Example**: "I tried using A5 (People Over Rules) to justify breaking a workplace policy, but it backfired because I was actually just avoiding accountability for my mistake. The framework needs better guidance on distinguishing genuine A5 situations from weaponization."

### Body Knows Contributions

If you used Body Knows Protocol:

- Where did you physically feel the entry point? (tears, chest expansion, stomach contraction, vertigo)
- Which part of framework did that lead you to?
- Did the somatic signal accurately predict relevance?
- Any surprises or mismatches?

**Example**: "I cried reading the temporal murder section. I'm a teacher and calculated how much student learning time is destroyed by standardized test prep. This entry through tears led me directly to the structural repair work my school actually needs."

## 💬 Questions & Help

**"I'm not sure if my observation is worth contributing"**  
If you noticed something, it's worth sharing. Worst case: it's not useful and we thank you anyway. Best case: it reveals something important we missed.

**"I don't understand Good-Faith well enough to contribute"**  
Your confusion might reveal unclear documentation. "I don't understand what A4 means in practice" is a valuable contribution because it tells us where to improve explanations.

**"I found something but I'm worried I'm wrong"**  
Sanctuary for Doubt: Being wrong is safe here. Share it anyway. If you're wrong, we'll learn something together about where the framework is confusing.

**"My contribution is too small/trivial/obvious"**  
Small observations compound into big insights. "I noticed people use R16 (Obviousness Shield) constantly in meetings" is useful even if it seems obvious to you.

**"I want to contribute but don't know how to use GitHub"**  
Open a GitHub issue and just write what you want to share. We'll handle the technical parts. Or email contributions@goodfaith.org (if we set that up) or find us on Discord/wherever we are.

### Where to Ask Questions

- **GitHub Discussions**: Best for framework interpretation questions
- **GitHub Issues**: Good for "is this a bug or am I confused?" questions
- **Discord/Community channels**: Real-time discussion (if we set these up)

## 🌱 Community Principles

Instead of a traditional Code of Conduct, we operate on Good-Faith principles:

### Act in Good Faith (Seed 2)

Approach contributions to improve the framework, not to dominate discussions or "win" arguments. Assume other contributors are trying to help until proven otherwise.

### Take Honest Positions (Seed 1)

Share what you actually observed, not what you think sounds impressive. Admit when you're uncertain. Declare if you have conflicts of interest.

### Safe Refusal (A3)

You can always decline to:
- Answer personal questions
- Share identifying information
- Engage with bad-faith actors
- Continue unproductive conversations

Refusal should carry no penalty.

### People Over Rules (A5)

These guidelines serve contributors, not the other way around. If following a guideline would harm someone or prevent valuable contribution, break the guideline and document why.

### Structural Repair (A4)

If someone causes harm in the community:
1. Name the harm specifically
2. Stop it immediately
3. Propose structural change to prevent recurrence

Don't just ban people—fix the system that allowed harm.

### Exit Protocol

Anyone can leave if:
- Three documented requests for harm repair are ignored
- Retaliation occurs for protected refusals
- Imminent harm with no mitigation in 5 days
- Coercion to falsify records or evidence

Document your reasons clearly when exiting.

### What Triggers Exit Response

If someone is:
- Using framework to "win" arguments rather than solve problems
- Deliberately distorting framework concepts
- Retaliating against good-faith criticism
- Creating unsafe environment for contributors

We document via harm ledger, request structural repair, and exit them if necessary.

## 🙏 Why This Matters

Good-Faith grows through use. Every real-world test is data. Every anecdote reveals something. Every failed application shows us boundaries. Every thought experiment strengthens the framework.

You're not just contributing to a project—you're helping discover ethical structure that already exists. We're all archaeologists here, carefully excavating what works and documenting what we find.

**This is archaeology, not architecture. Your shovel is welcome.**

---

## 📊 What Happens to Your Contribution

### Review Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll respond within 1 week (usually faster)
2. **Discussion**: If we need clarification, we'll ask questions
3. **Integration**: If incorporating into framework, we'll discuss where/how
4. **Credit**: You'll be acknowledged per A10 unless you decline

### Different Types Get Different Treatment

- **Anecdotes/stories**: Usually added to examples collection or cited in deployment blueprints
- **Bug reports**: Investigated, fixed if confirmed, credited in patch notes
- **Pattern discoveries**: Evaluated for formalization, may become new framework component
- **Documentation improvements**: Reviewed for accuracy and clarity, merged if helpful
- **Code contributions**: Tested, reviewed, merged with credit

### Timeline Expectations

- **Simple documentation fixes**: Days
- **New examples**: 1-2 weeks
- **Pattern evaluation**: 2-4 weeks (need to test against existing framework)
- **Major structural changes**: Months (require extensive validation)

We're not fast, but we're thorough. Per A0 (Transparent Knowledge), we'll keep you updated on status.

## 🔬 Special: Failed Experiments Welcome

Seriously. If you tried something and it completely didn't work, that's valuable.

**Useful failure reports include**:
- What you tried
- Why you thought it would work
- What actually happened
- Your theory on why it failed
- What you'd try differently

**Example of valuable failure**:
> "I tried using temporal murder calculator on my commute time and concluded my employer was committing 0.5 temporal murders annually by requiring office presence. But when I presented this, it came across as absurd rather than compelling because everyone has commutes. Learning: Framework needs guidance on baseline vs. excess temporal costs. Commute time is different from forcing someone to wait 4 hours at DMV for 10-minute transaction."

This teaches us about framework boundaries.
