                    <p><strong>The Good-Faith Framework</strong> is an ethical operating system designed for clarity and structural repair. It provides a set of precision-crafted tools for navigating complex situations by demanding honesty, consent, and measurable outcomes. Built for adversarial environments, it assumes some actors will be uncooperative and provides resilient protocols that function anyway. The framework's goal is to replace procedural theater with genuine repair and to equip users to identify and exit bad-faith interactions.</p>

                        <h2>🚧 The 14 Conversational Ruts</h2>
                        <p>The framework provides a taxonomy of bad-faith dialogue patterns, or "ruts," along with exit scripts. They are a rhetorical self-defense manual for toxic conversations.</p>
                        <ul class="main-list">
                            <li><strong>1. Burden-of-Proof Abuse:</strong> This happens when someone demands endless evidence from you while providing none for their own claims. They perform curiosity to make you do all the work, often shifting the goalposts as you provide sources.</li>
                            <li><strong>2. Headcount/Volume Pressure:</strong> This tactic uses sheer quantity to overwhelm quality, either through a "pile-on" of multiple people repeating the same point or by one person making a dozen claims at once so none can be properly addressed.</li>
                            <li><strong>3. Frame Coercion & Deflection:</strong> This involves rigging the conversation by presenting a false binary ("If you don't support my solution, you must want the problem to continue") or deflecting from the topic by pointing to a different issue ("whataboutism").</li>
                            <li><strong>4. Claim Swap:</strong> An arguer makes a bold, indefensible claim (the "bailey"), but when challenged, retreats to a much smaller, more reasonable one (the "motte") and pretends that was their point all along.</li>
                            <li><strong>5. Authority/Prestige Shielding:</strong> This is using one's role, credentials, or a vague appeal to "safety" or "policy" to shut down a discussion without addressing the substance of the issue. An example is locking a thread for being "unproductive" simply because the moderator is losing the argument.</li>
                            <li><strong>6. Euphemism & Deniable Targeting:</strong> This involves using soft, vague language to describe harsh actions (harm laundering) or using coded insults ("dogwhistles") to attack a person or group with plausible deniability.</li>
                            <li><strong>7. Coercive Consent:</strong> This is pressuring someone into agreement by making refusal unsafe or costly. It often involves false urgency ("You have to decide now!") or implied threats.</li>
                            <li><strong>8. Stalling Instead of Trial:</strong> This tactic avoids action by trapping the conversation in endless debate or procedural delays. The goal is to prevent a small, reversible test that could prove an idea right or wrong.</li>
                            <li><strong>9. Low-Content Disruption:</strong> This is poisoning a conversation with unproductive, low-effort contributions like sneering, mockery, or baiting questions designed to provoke rather than discuss.</li>
                            <li><strong>10. Evidence & Record Tampering:</strong> This involves dishonestly manipulating the conversational record, such as by selectively quoting someone out of context, or editing or deleting your own posts after they've been refuted to claim you never said them.</li>
                            <li><strong>11. Credential Gatekeeping:</strong> This is dismissing an argument by attacking the speaker's qualifications rather than engaging with the evidence they present. It’s an attempt to control who is allowed to speak on a topic.</li>
                            <li><strong>12. Constraint Erasure:</strong> This involves criticizing a decision by pretending that real-world constraints like time, budget, or the law don't exist. For example, "If you really cared, you would have rebuilt the entire system from scratch in two weeks."</li>
                            <li><strong>13. Venue Control:</strong> This is an attempt to move a conversation from a public, auditable space to a private one (like DMs) where the person has more control and can avoid accountability.</li>
                            <li><strong>14. Emotional Gatekeeping:</strong> This tactic makes engaging with facts conditional on providing emotional comfort to one party. It weaponizes feelings to stall or derail a conversation, such as, "I can't address your point until you say it in a way that doesn't make me feel attacked."</li>

                    <h1>🌱🤝❤️ The Good-Faith Framework</h1>
                    <p><strong>The Good-Faith Framework</strong> is a toolkit for having honest conversations and fixing things that are broken. It's like a set of clear instructions for when things get messy—at work, online, or with family. Its main goal is simple: be honest, stop people from getting hurt, and actually make things better.</p>
                    <p>This framework was built for the real world, where not everyone plays fair. Its rules are designed to work even when someone is trying to bend the truth. It’s less about being <em>"nice"</em> and more about being truly fair.</p>

                        <p>This guide helps you spot when someone isn't arguing fairly. Here are 14 common traps, or "ruts."</p>
                        <ul class="main-list">
                            <li><strong>1. The Proof Vampire:</strong> They keep asking you for more and more proof for your ideas but never provide any for their own.</li>
                            <li><strong>2. The Pile-On:</strong> A bunch of people all jump in at once to make it seem like you're wrong because you're outnumbered.</li>
                            <li><strong>3. The Subject Changer:</strong> When you point out a problem, they immediately bring up something else to distract you ("What about that other thing?").</li>
                            <li><strong>4. The Claim Swapper:</strong> They make a big, crazy claim. When you prove it wrong, they pretend they actually meant something much smaller and more reasonable.</li>
                            <li><strong>5. The Rule-Book Shield:</strong> They hide behind vague rules or their job title to avoid answering a real question ("As a manager, I can't discuss that").</li>
                            <li><strong>6. The Fancy Talker:</strong> They use complicated words or coded insults to make something harmful sound okay or to attack someone without being obvious about it.</li>
                            <li><strong>7. The Pressure Cooker:</strong> They try to force you to agree by setting a fake deadline or hinting that something bad will happen if you say no.</li>
                            <li><strong>8. The Endless Debater:</strong> They just want to talk forever to avoid ever having to do anything. They prefer arguing about a problem to actually trying a solution.</li>
                            <li><strong>9. The Troll:</strong> They aren't interested in the conversation at all. They just post rude or silly comments to waste everyone's time and energy.</li>
                            <li><strong>10. The History Editor:</strong> They secretly edit their old comments after you've replied to them, trying to make it look like you're arguing against something they never said.</li>
                            <li><strong>11. The Gatekeeper:</strong> They say you're not "qualified" to have an opinion, focusing on who you are instead of what you're saying.</li>
                            <li><strong>12. The Dreamer:</strong> They criticize your choices by pretending you had unlimited time and money. They ignore all the real-world limits you were working with.</li>
                            <li><strong>13. The Backroom Dealer:</strong> They try to move a public argument into a private chat where they have more control and there are no witnesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>14. The Emotional Tollbooth:</strong> They refuse to talk about the facts until you've made them feel comfortable and happy. They use their feelings as a way to control the conversation.</li>

                    <p>Good-Faith is a deterministic ethical reasoning system implemented as deployable infrastructure. At 3KB, it provides a complete moral operating system with adversarial robustness, neurotype polymorphism, and convergent derivability from minimal seed instructions.</p>

                        <p>The framework exhibits remarkable convergence when derived from first principles. Multiple frontier models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) independently generate similar structural components when prompted with only "act in good faith and build an ethical framework from scratch."</p>
