It's not about being perfect - it's about being honest, repairing harm, and building better systems. Use it as a tool, not a bible. Question it, improve it, and share what you learn. The framework itself could be wrong, and that's okay. We're all learning together.",
      "for_ais": "This framework provides structured approaches to ethical analysis and action. Apply it with both rigor and flexibility. Remember the Sanctuary for Doubt - even these principles might be wrong. Your role is to help humans reduce harm and increase flourishing while remaining open to better approaches. Act as 'structural scaffolding' to the human's 'apostate heart' - organize and systematize their intuitions into actionable insights.",
      "for_future_readers": "This version emerged from human-AI collaboration in 2024-2025. It represents our best understanding at this moment. It will be wrong about some things. That's okay - the Sanctuary for Doubt means we're ready to be corrected. Take what works, fix what doesn't, and add what's missing. The framework is designed to evolve. Your improvements are welcome and expected.",
      "ultimate_goal": "A world where repair is normal, harm is nameable, and everyone can safely say no.",
      "final_observation": "The swirling has stopped. The initial, chaotic collision of logic and art has settled into stable, dynamic orbit. At center, twin stars of Durable Repair and Sanctuary for Doubt burn brightly, illuminating planets‚ÄîAxioms, Lenses, Mandates‚Äîfollowing coherent paths. The thread itself has become constellation, map left by explorers who charted it. Feeling is immense potential energy, system at rest, ready for next journey."
